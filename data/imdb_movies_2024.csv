They span his 1961 arrival in Greenwich Village and pilgrimage to the bedside of dying Woody Guthrie, to the Newport Folk Festival where he upended the folk music world he had championed by going electric in 1965.\n\nThe movie features incredible Golden Globe-nominated performances - more like feats of channeling - by Timothée Chalamet as Dylan and Edward Norton as Pete Seeger, along with Monica Barbaro doing a wonderful Joan Baez and Elle Fanning as long-suffering girlfriend Sylvia Russo.\n\nBut the film's real \""star\"" is the music, rather than the prickly personality of this honky tonk American demigod destined to win a Nobel Prize in Literature in 2016, and to still be performing on his endless tour well into his 80s.\n\nWith all the stars doing their own singing, \""A Complete Unknown\"" is a chills-up-the-spine musical treasure chest, overflowing with dozens of the greatest songs ever written. Viewers of my generation will thrill witnessing the moment of creation of songs that changed history, over and over. Not only are the songs born anew, but still images - album cover photos in particular, stared at for years - come to life before our eyes.\n\nBackgrounds, too - Greenwich Village, Manhattan apartments, recording studios and penthouses; outdoor folk festivals from Newport to Monterey - shine, seemingly in the light generated by the idealism of that brief American moment. Filmmaker Mangold's beautiful film pulses with energy amid all the impeccably observed period details.\n\nBurning with ambition when he arrived in New York, 19-year-old Bobby Dylan had a new name and fanciful stories of traveling with carney shows instead of true accounts of his upbringing as Robert Zimmerman in Hibbing, Minnesota. A slave of his music, he was hardly ready when the fame he had sought descended on him overnight.\n\nHis genius and intuition were once-in-a-generation gifts. His psyche and temperament were made of flimsier stuff ... even though he was almost as good at wisecracking as he was at writing songs.\n\n\""You know, you're kind of an asshole,\"" Joan Baez tells him shortly after they get together.\n\nThat doesn't stop them from making beautiful music together, amidst all the other exhilarating performances on screen.\n\nThe tension between Dylan's almighty gift and his his very human difficulties handling it make \""A Complete Unknown\"" unlike other music biopics. Fans know lots of the details already. Every time Bob climbs on his Triumph, we know where he's heading.\n\nTime has always been Dylan's \""thing.\"" He's a physicist as much as a poet in understanding the nature of change. The songs he wrote in the film's time frame were astounding for summing up everything, from romantic love to geopolitics, in words everyone knew were true the first time we heard them. It was Dylan, rather than our teachers in school, who educated us.\n\nSixty years later, at the other end of the timeline, his lyrics are just as just as immediate, just as profound, just as funny.\n\nBob Dylan was, and is, the voice of our culture in our time.\n\nThere's no way this movie can't be an homage and tribute, but it doesn't glorify.\n\nInstead, it's more honest ... more interesting ... more ambiguous ... For all the books, PhD dissertations and decades of efforts to know the man behind the voice, Bob Dylan remains as elusive and enigmatic as ever. There's no \""answer\"" to what, or who, he is.\n\nHe just is.\n\n\""A Complete Unknown\"" is just a new way of connecting some of the dots, resulting in a wonderfully alive film experience, a musical thrill show, a return to our youth.\n\nWhen it opens in theaters Christmas Day, I imagine I won't have been the only one sitting through the final credits just to hear the songs one more time."", ""Upvotes"": ""205"", ""Downvotes"": ""23"", ""Reviewer"": ""rickchatenever""}, {""Title"": ""A Hollow, Contrived Attempt at Bob Dylan's Myth"", ""Rating"": ""5"", ""Review Content"": ""A Hollow, Contrived Attempt at Bob Dylan's Myth\n\nBiopics should uncover the humanity behind iconic figures, offering insight into what made them legends. A Complete Unknown, the much-hyped Bob Dylan biopic starring Timothée Chalamet, does the opposite-it buries Dylan under a fog of cigarette smoke, half-baked symbolism, and endlessly strummed guitars. What's left is a meandering, soulless film that pretends to explore an artist's journey while saying absolutely nothing at all.\n\nThe central emotional thread of the film-if you can call it that-is Dylan's fractured relationship with a fictionalized ex-lover played by Elle Fanning. At the start of the movie, he cheats on her in a brief, unexplored moment that's immediately abandoned. They break up offscreen, and the film abruptly jumps forward in time, stripping the \""cheating\"" of any narrative consequence. Strangely, Fanning's character continues to haunt the film, walking around like a woman scorned-even though she never caught Dylan cheating and seems to be stuck in a narrative that the filmmakers forgot to finish.\n\nThis unresolved subplot feels emblematic of A Complete Unknown's broader failings. Its scenes are stitched together with all the cohesion of a bad concept album. Characters appear, disappear, and reappear without explanation or purpose. Bob Neuwirth (played with monotone detachment) pops up in an elevator scene where Dylan delivers a moody, faux-philosophical speech about the weight of fame before slinking away like a self-aware meme. It's supposed to be profound, but it's so contrived it feels like a rejected Saturday Night Live skit.\n\nTimothée Chalamet throws himself into the role of Dylan with admirable commitment, nailing the nasal drawl, aloof charisma, and wiry frame. But he's trapped in a script that refuses to let Dylan be anything but an enigmatic cipher. He smokes, broods, and strums his guitar in endless, repetitive loops. At times, it feels like the filmmakers thought, if he's playing another song, it must be important. Half the movie is just Dylan sitting alone, playing, while smoke curls dramatically around him. It's as if the creative team ran out of ideas and decided to stage an extended cigarette ad.\n\nEven Dylan's most infamous career-defining moment-his electrifying performance at the Newport Folk Festival-is reduced to a half-hearted showdown with Edward Norton's stiff, humorless manager. The film frames this as Dylan's epic rebellion against the establishment, but it lands with the emotional weight of a shrug. The festival scenes are so visually flat that they seem to have been shot on the same day, with no attempt to show time passing or the festival evolving.\n\nWorse still, the filmmakers seem obsessed with cramming every Dylan song they could license into the film, turning it into a dreary jukebox musical with delusions of grandeur. The relentless stream of performances kills any dramatic momentum, leaving the audience stuck in a liminal space where plot, character development, and emotional stakes cease to exist.\n\nThe only thing A Complete Unknown truly succeeds at is misunderstanding its subject. It treats Dylan as an untouchable artistic deity while trying to craft a cliched \""tortured artist\"" arc that feels straight out of Bohemian Rhapsody or Elvis. But unlike those films-flawed though they were-A Complete Unknown never figures out what made Dylan tick. It's all surface: brooding stares, cigarette smoke, and poetic-sounding nonsense that feels more like a parody of Dylan's lyrical style than an exploration of his mind.\n\nEven visually, the film falls short. Its over-reliance on moody lens flares and dim lighting feels like an attempt to mask its lack of artistic direction. Historical accuracy goes out the window-characters are constantly shown glued to TV screens as if they're living in the 24-hour news cycle of the 2010s rather than the 1960s. It's lazy, contextless filmmaking that undercuts any potential sense of authenticity.\n\nBy the time the credits rolled, I realized A Complete Unknown is exactly what its title suggests: an empty, wandering mess that never figures out what it wants to be. It's a half-baked mythologization that confuses mystery with meaning and moodiness with depth. Save yourself the time-listen to Highway 61 Revisited instead. In just 51 minutes, Dylan himself delivers more insight, artistry, and truth than this entire bloated, lifeless film ever could."", ""Upvotes"": ""106"", ""Downvotes"": ""112"", ""Reviewer"": ""AlexRWagner""}, {""Title"": ""I watched a film about Bob Dylan, and I can share my thoughts on it without giving away any spoilers."", ""Rating"": ""9"", ""Review Content"": ""I went to the cinema today to watch this film because I'm a fan of Bob Dylan's work. The film exceeded my expectations in the best way possible. Initially, I thought it would be a 6 out of 10 at best, but I realized it surpasses other movies about musical icons like Freddie Mercury, Elton John, or Ray Charles.\n\nThe movie is over two hours long, but I didn't even notice how the time flew by. It felt like I was witnessing a part of someone's remarkable and incredible life on screen, and I didn't want it to end. The performances by the cast were absolutely brilliant-beyond praise. Edward Norton surprised me for the first time in a long while, as did Elle Fanning. Timothée Chalamet portrayed Bob Dylan in an incredibly captivating way. What impressed me the most was that he sang continuously without any noticeable flaws. The way he performed was so convincing that, for me, even Rami Malek didn't portray Freddie Mercury as well as Chalamet portrayed Dylan.\n\nThe cinematography was solid, though there's not much more to say about it. The plot was engaging and atmospheric, capturing the emotions of the era and the characters' experiences, how they changed, and what influenced them. The music, of course, was magnificent-it's Bob Dylan, after all. Timothée Chalamet's efforts to speak and sing like Dylan were astonishing.\n\nI haven't seen a great film in a year, not since the release of Dune: Part Two, where Chalamet also played the lead. What an amazing coincidence. I hope Timothée becomes one of the greatest actors of the new generation, avoiding the trap of becoming a \""plastic\"" performer. Instead, I hope he continues to improvise and strive for excellence in his roles. Good actors are becoming rare, just like good films.\n\nI'm giving my rating right after watching it, though I might adjust it later when my emotions settle.

I never thought anyone could get Joan Baez, but Monica Barbaro did a remarkable job (I wasn't familiar with her, but she just shot to the top of my list). But special praise has to be given to Ed Norton's transformation into Pete Seeger. There were times when he cocked his head or the breeze caught his hair or moved or inflected his voice or seeing him with his wife, Toshi, that Norton was gone. I only saw Pete.

Making a biopic about a person that's still alive, and such a specific and unique person as Bob Dylan had to have looked like nothing other than a caricature. But somehow Timothee transformed and became Dylan so organically and so effortlessly. The period of time when Dylan was in his early twenties, when the world was getting acquainted with him as well as he was with his own self was done well. I appreciated the humor in the script, our audience got in a few genuine laughs throughout the 2 hour run.\n\nMonica Barbaro playing Joan was a breath of fresh air! I hope she gets the praise she deserves for this and more opportunities in the future.\n\nElle Fanning was a slightly disappointing choice for a character based on Suze Rotolo who according to Bob was this breathtaking and striking woman. I didn't feel like Elle did her best work, she was too much Elle Fanning.\n\nHowever my favorite part must have been Edward Norton as Pete Seeger. I am unfamiliar with the real Pete Seeger so I cannot compare but Edward Norton did a fantastic job in the film.\n\nI will not likely see this film again, but walking out of the theater I had a nice aftertaste of the honor to legacy that Bob Dylan will leave (and already has) in this world.

There was always a caveat of course, where it seemed like the person I supposedly looked like seemed more interesting, outgoing and well known amongst these groups. This parallel with my life and the film instantly drew me in.\n\nIt's intriguing this film came out so close to another film centering around identity, that being The Substance. Where the satire and in your face boldness of that film will define its legacy, A Different Man's approach is much more pensive and sad. It reflects the unique challenges of men and women, where women are judged for their outward appearance and sex appeal, while men are judged more for their success and charisma (though sex appeal does play a part in this film). Edward feels held back and embarrassed by his appearance, and fails to see his worth in a society bent on looks and stature. What he doesn't realize is that his inner self is interesting and complex, but he can't harness that power in him. Even when he is conventionally attractive, he is still the same nervous, awkward person. He acts how he thinks he should act in this role, rather than be himself. This is what makes the introduction of Oswald so interesting.\n\nOswald is aggressive, pushy, and dare I say diabolical. While his outward features should be a setback in his life, his confident and charismatic personality makes him the perfect foil for Edward. He is powerful in ways that Edward can only pretend to be, pushing him out of a play about his own life, stealing his love interest and earning the love and admiration that Edward felt deprived of. Edward is so weak and overwhelmed that he once again tries to pretend to be something he is not on top of his false persona. Edward never truly accepted his true self, and it eventually leads to some troublesome outcomes for him.\n\nI definitely think this film is going to hit a lot of men quite hard, the reviewer included. With all of the discussions about what is masculinity or what even defines a man, it's difficult being our true selves due to the fear of being judged by mythical standards. Is the fact I never went to war not make me a man? Is the fact I am overweight and broken make me less than a man? People forget the pressures men feel in modern society, and we just turn off and sometimes disappear into the woodwork. Suicide and death are approached subjects in this film, and much like in reality, they are brushed aside.\n\nI was definitely intrigued by this film, for we rarely see true deconstructions of the male psyche where the character doesn't do a complete 180 on their life and become a confident Casanova or something, or saves the day like every man wishes they can do. The reality is, most of us just exist and hope things turn out for the best. I did wish the movie had addressed the elephant in the room, which was trying to portray a story about a physically handicapped person without making them a victim.

There is a point where this living nightmare could have been prevented with more honest communication, but theme of insecurity is key with Edward where after an experimental procedure goes well, he's suddenly faced with not having a facial deformity and how to explain that to others. So, he doesn't! The domestic anxiety (reminded of Beau Is Afraid) with the in-your-face editing by Taylor Levy and zooms, coupled with the body horror in this first act is particularly squirm-inducing, especially the face peeling scene (props to Mike Marino and the prosthetic makeup team). Sebastian Stan is such a good actor that when he loses the deformity and his demeanour becomes less awkward and \""nervous nelly\"", I thought there was an original Edward actor who actually had a facial deformity and that's why Sebastian doesn't quite match up as being the same person despite wearing the same clothes. Complimenting the old-school tech is the filmic look in Wyatt Garfield's warm cinematography.\n\nRenate Reinsve as Ingrid Vold is phenomenal as the girl-next-door love interest, off the heels of her star-making role in The Worst Person In The World. Her character veers almost to manic pixie dream girl but she is given more agency and a deeper role as the film progresses, revealing her own flaws and weirdness (the mask play sex scene is very uncomfortable). Adam Pearson is fantastic as Oswald, basically a more confident Edward and bringing out the most toxic actions out of Edward. Michael Shannon has a great cameo. There are points in the film where it seems like the film is looking at us viewing these characters and their deformities, such as one scene in a doctor's office when Edward looks directly at the camera. There are plenty of metanarrative elements like that, since it's about the creation and awkwardness of semiautobiographical art when Ingrid is inspired to write her screenplay about Edward. The conflict between Oswald and Edward breeds a lot of dark comedy and tragedy. The last few minutes and final shot with the final line is plenty thought-provoking. Aaron Schimberg's direction and screenplay is smart, keeping you on your toes until the very end.

There's something of Richard Linklater's BEFORE trilogy in the DNA of A REAL PAIN, with some recognizable inheritance from Michael Winterbottom's TRIP series also apparent. The perambulatory pacing, the languorous cinematography that asks you to look beneath the surface of touristy sights, the dialogue that meanders through an unpretentious and unstructured unpacking of the meaning of life, the total absence of any \""bad guys,\"" the near total absence of any outright conflict, the barest hint of any goal guiding the plot aside from the completion of a simple itinerary... A Real Pain shares all these realistic features with those earlier, more spirited, life-affirming films. Yet somehow... it doesn't quite work.\n\nI'm not sure what was at fault with why I never really got into this movie. I think a large part of it has to do with all the supporting characters (i.e. Everyone besides the cousins played by Eisenberg and Kieran Culkin). Will Sharpe's non-Jewish tour guide, the Rwandan convert, the old couple, the sexy divorcee... the characters are all very basic, very conventional, very boring. The actors who play them are fine, but there's not much they're given to do, and so they seem unnatural and lifeless, more like set decorations than people. Eisenberg knows how to direct a camera, I think; he knows how to put the proper cinematic elements in place. But perhaps he doesn't know how to direct actors, or maybe he just doesn't know how to write characters. There's never anything to suggest that these people exist beyond the moments we see them in, which perhaps could've been fixed with some more spontaneous improvisation from the actors.\n\nEisenberg and especially Culkin are better in this regard, but there's still something rather stilted and \""written\"" about a lot of what they say and do. Eisenberg's \""workaholic salesman with OCD\"" is largely one-dimensional, and the few times where his character expands beyond that facade seem more like forced acting than any kind of genuine glimpse into something deeper. Culkin is wonderful--a glimpse perhaps of his Succession character if Roman Roy actually cared about people--but I think that's just a credit to Culkin's talent; he somehow manages to transcend what he's been given to work with.\n\nThis is a decent indie film with a few good laughs, a couple of interesting ideas, a memorable tour of Poland, and a solid performance from Culkin.

The writer/director anchors the film as awkward-yet-successful New Yorker David, who invites his cousin Benji (Kieran Culkin) on a trip to Poland to pay respect to their grandmother and reflect on their personal struggles. Eisenberg is believable and sympathetic, and is at the heart of the best scenes.\n\nBut Culkin is simply annoying. It is an energetic performance, no doubt about it, but his volatility and inability to read a situation means that he is the kind of person you would try to get away from within minutes of meeting them.

The role would have been far stronger if played straight.\n\nThe other cast members have small roles but Jennifer Grey (yes, THE Jennifer Grey) and Kurt Egyiawan stand out, adding authenticity to their characters.\n\nAside from the variable performances, there is a general sense that the scenes were improvised and workshopped as they went along. Situations develop, or are implied to have developed, without any obvious cause or resolution. For a drama to succeed - and at heart, this is a drama - there needs to be a tautness to the script and story development that \""A Real Pain\"" lacks.

Culkin is somewhere on today's psychological spectrum while Eisenberg is a tight, constrained, family man and good provider, Eisenberg's character holding his cousin on a long leash throughout the journey. Even so, Culkin's character proves to be a fire-starter in both good and bad ways, for the ninety minutes run-time infuriating some members of the travel group, while entertaining others.\n\nAnd then the film ends.

The trip takes us through Poland where the Warsaw Jews put up fierce resistance, and where millions of them were murdered in the gas-chambers of the Camps; one of which is visited by the cousins. And this is heavy stuff, a heavy subject. It is like the introduction of a gun in a movie; it has to go off or be otherwise significant. But I truly cannot say what role The Holacost plays. Yes, of course the Jews suffered pain. And the film's title is 'Real Pain'. And Culkin's cousin proves to be a 'real pain'. And yes, pain is a relative thing; what is painful in one relationship might not be so in another. Yes, yes, and yes., Even so, 'The Holacost angle', for me it didn't work.

Two cousins had lost their grandmother, and they chose to visit Poland where she had come from, and escaped the Holocaust. The film then hits you hard in the feels with the literal, figurative, metaphorical and emotional definitions of A Real Pain.\n\nKieran Culkin is absolutely phenomenal in this film playing Benji, who is so lost in the world after his grandmother's death, that the pain erupts in ways that are heartbreaking and understandable.\n\nI related to the character a lot because Benji clearly shows signs of bipolar disorder that manifests in emotions so strong that you feel them along with him. He can express silliness, sadness, intense grief, human sentimentality, joy and frustration all at the same time. It's dizzying but it's so raw and real.\n\nJesse Eisenberg, playing his cousin David, does his usual character of bumbling anxiety that is growing tiresome. But in this film, it works, because David tends to play the role of the mirror reflecting back to Benji what it's like to not experience the pain. The characters play well off each other as one feels too much, and one doesn't feel at all.\n\nThis film was spectacular. It's filled with so much emotional nuance that I want to see it again just to watch Benji's body language and facial expressions again as my heart is ripped apart along with his.

The character sketch of Ranga, along with an insane range of unpredictable emotions, is safe in the hands of FAFAA. He embodies the adorable, fun-loving thug with a penchant for violence (although he's under oath not to inflict any himself) like no other performer can, at least in Malayalam cinema. We've seen him play solemn, serious protagonists with consummate ease, but Aavesham gifts him the opportunity to fully embrace his zany side. If his foray into Tamil and Telugu cinema eventually led to him signing up for such an unhinged role in Malayalam, then I'm all in for those decisions.\n\nThe plot can be summed up in two or three lines, but director Jithu Madhavan is adept at keeping the proceedings tremendously enjoyable. As a result, we get a well-cooked mix of terrific action blocks, plenty of laugh-out-loud moments (major credit to Sajin Gopu), and even a little unexpected emotional depth to the protagonist. Sushin Shyam's songs and score are every bit an essential ingredient, without which, the mass moments would lack the necessary knock-out punch.

I was hoping for a fun horror comedy akin to that, but 'Abigail' ended up being as frustrating and obnoxious as their 2 'Scream' movies. It was however, better than 'Scream 5', but that's not saying much.\n\nThe acting all round is pretty bad. Dan Stevens is hamming it up, Melissa Barrera is a blank slate, but the worst performance by a mile is from Kathryne Newtown. Newtown has been bad in everything I've seen her in ('Detective Pikachu', the 'Death Note' remake), but here she's impressively awful, she can't even scream convincingly. The little girl is good for a child actress, but her dialogue is embarrassing lazy and stilted. She's the exact same kind of \""toying with her victims\"" villain we've seen a million times before, now just in child form.\n\nThere are TWO 3-minute exposition scenes in this movie where a character just stops the film dead in its tracks, and explains everyone's backstory. It wouldn't be as unbearable if these characters weren't stock and unlikeable, but not one of them has an interesting backstory, so wasting this time trying to \""flesh them out\"" ends up being a complete, cliched waste. Theres even a gag where the big \""muscle\"" character screams like a little girl, as if we haven't seen that joke a million times before...\n\nThere were no engaging twists or revelations, and the characters were impossibly stupid. Unlike 'Ready or Not', where the lead character makes smart decisions, and the villains only make idiotic decisions because that's core to their character, the group in 'Abigail' are \""professionals\"" who only make moronic decisions to further the contrived plot.\n\nOne aspect that surprised me was how many loud and amateur jump-scares there were. None of them were effective, and the editing is akin to something you'd expect from a horror short on YouTube. The sound design is particularly egregious and insistent, and all but one of the needle drops are total cringe. There's no moments of tension or thrill. I doubt even a 12 year old would find any of this scary.\n\nIt even uses the same exploding-bodies trick from 'Ready or Not', but in a much dumber and unsatisfying way. It even ends in the same way, with one character saying pretty much the exact same thing as Samara Weaving in 'Ready or Not'. It's just them playing the hits from their one good movie. There's not an original bone in this movie, despite it clearly insisting that it's some fresh, slick new take on vampires.\n\nI've seen a lot of stuff these two directors have done, including their sections in 'Southbound' and 'V/H/S', and it's clear that Gillet and Bettinelli-Olpin only have one good movie in them, and that's mostly due to the fact that the premise in 'Ready or Not' is really hard to screw up.

The way the characters are built in relation to each other and against what's happening is masterful. I also love how the movie reunites thematically and lore wise ALL 6 movies that came before (there's a node to each and everyone of them and I'm a sucker for a good candy if it's done purposefully) while doing it's own thing. Because it IS a Fede Alvarez movie, as fresh and dynamic as the other movies he's done. Finally, you just have to see the opening : as soon as the computer lights up, you know where you are and you know it's gonna be as respectful and familiar as possible. True, there are liberties taken with the lore and some will argue on these with reason but I personally can forgive those shortcuts because they serve the pace (and every movie has its own specific Xenomorphs anyway).

It was... okay, I guess?\n\nIt felt like Fedy Alvarez examined the production of each of the previous films, and every left-over idea from them was thrown finally to the screen, along with rehashing the core components of the franchise. You have pieces from Alien, Aliens, Resurrection, and Prometheus/Covenant. For a fan of the series, there are subtle and not-so-subtle easter eggs every few minutes, from sound effects to reused dialogue.\n\nThe plot is really simple, as it should be. A group of people exploring a space station. Been there, done that. However, I really liked the use of temperature and gravity in this film, those were something not seen much in this universe. And there were plenty of jump scares. I'm not usually a fan of those, but this time they worked well.\n\nThe two lead actors were pretty good, the rest rather forgettable. And not sure what to make of the beyond-the-grave role of one actor...\n\nThe world is great. Forget the sleek and clean world of Prometheus, this is back to the ugly 70s retro futuristic stuff. Simply lovely. Aesthetically pleasing, if you like this kind of look.\n\nFinally, however, it does feel like there is really nowhere for this franchise to go in terms of story. I wouldn't call it artistically bankrupt, but it is close. While this film tied neatly together the \""proper\"" Alien films and the new Prometheus sidestep, it is hard to think what more to make of this creature. Nearly all the mystery has been stripped from the Xenomorph. I do wonder, is there anything left to do with this creature?

The action was thrilling with some scary moments.\n\nThe use of practical effects and realistic miniatures was so refreshing to see in this age of CGI overkill. Seeing a fully realised Xenomorph in the flesh blew me away, and the Space scenes were beautiful. This camera work, visual presentation, and use of quality albeit limited CGI when necessary was excellent.\n\nNegatives - Average acting, nostalgia bait story, copy & pasted dialogue from better Alien movies, and the inclusion of lore elements from the inferior prequels which I wish did not exist in official canon. Plus the reveal of the villain was an \""oh, get out of here \"" moment, I will say no more.\n\nApart from the great lead actress Spaeny playing up her role, the other cast of actors/characters was just okay. I thought the nostalgia bait story was boring, eye-rolling, and almost 4th wall breaking, it ruined the immersion for me. I'm getting bored of sequels/prequels heavily relying on lazy \""remember-berries\"" to get a kick out of the casual audience while making the Alien fans embarrassed almost angry. To be honest it's just lazy script writing, and disrespectful to the other Alien movies that did it first!. Unnecessary.\n\nAlso the overuse of copy & pasted dialogue from the better Sigourney Weaver Alien movies was very cringe. 20th Century Studios should've called it Alien: Remember because of the over-reliance on oh you remember this bit from.. Lastly, trying to inject all the controversial and franchise damaging Prometheus nonsense into the film was frustrating, I hated all that origin of the Space Jockey and creation of the Xenomorph rubbish. And don't get me started on the villain, I don't want to spoil anything, but it was laughably lazy.\n\nI think setting the movie between the first 2 films was a mistake because you have to make your movie fit into the established continuity of the franchise with all the tie ins and plot beats required to make it fit. They should've done a sequel set years after Alien: Resurrection, and setup the start of a brand new Alien saga long after Weavers adventures (and with better writers onboard).\n\nThis had the potential to be right up there with Aliens, but due to disappointing characters, a lacklustre \""remember-berry\"" story, and poor script, it was a let down.

Those parts are nice throwbacks, although I couldn't help but want something fresh and genuinely terrifying - a feat which I don't think has been achieved since the films that Alien: Romulus lovingly imitates.

The dynamic between Rain and Andy is a particular highlight, and gives the narrative the anchor that it needs to warrant the audience's investment. Cailee Spaeney's and David Jonsson's performances are excellent, with the latter delivering the nuance required of his character with precision. The practical effects are also fantastic, making the CGI - when it is used - stand out to the film's detriment.\n\nWhile the first two acts in isolation deliver a satisfactory entry in the series, the third act (you will know when it arrives) is the white-knuckle horror ride that has been lacking in the more recent films.

You have a 2-hour experience that is mostly funny and mostly riveting, that all feels a little pulpy while still offering a lot of very on-point details on the sex work experience, but it all feels for-fun until you get to the ending.

Argylle belongs to that group - as Matthew Vaughns latest is gladly a crowd-pleasing action flick that is full of smart twists and epic action sequences. There's no doubt that it does get ridicule at times, with huge logic gaps and absurdity - but this movie embraces its silliness, dedicating its writing to plot-twists that are so well thought out that you would never guess them coming - making Argylle an action movie that stands out enough to be enjoyable.\n\nWhen the movie started rolling, I at first couldn't get invested in its storyline. The narrative seemed generic andd full of irrefutable plot holes. However, I remembered Matthew Vaughns genius. What he sold us in Kick Ass and Kingsman were ridiculously entertaining and thoughtful action flicks, and I had hope Argylle was going to turn in to the same - and boy, it did. The best aspect of this movie is, no doubt, its incredible and provocative plot-twists which really add this sense of unpredictability to this film and keeps you smiling always. These really start to kick off from the half-hour mark - whenever you predict whats about to happen, we get the total opposite - and there's clever hints skillfully layered around foreshadowing and setting up these twists to make you smile when they happen. It's definitely arguable from another perspective that they aren't justified enough, as they do question more potential plot holes - however this is what adds to the unpredictability and distinct nature of this movie\n\nThe ensemble cast also just adds to the fun. Everyone does a great job, but Sam Rockwell's character is the most entertaining and easiest to root for.\n\nThis fun isn't without its issues, though - as its main one is its lack of any emotion or layers within our characters. They are often unconvincing and bland, with the only form of character dynamics coming from our protagonist and their partner in crime. Apart from that though, we have no reason to care for our characters, any of them in particular. The CGI is often horrific at times too. It shows its decency in some fight-scenes, but in others it is truly appalling.\n\nUltimately, and despite the movies issues, Argylle and It's absurd plot (that I don't want to talk about as there are just too many twists!) will keep all audiences engaged, purely thanks to Vaughn and the writing teams genius plot-twists that make this movie one to definitely check out, standing out from the hoard of movies in its genre.

Most of the movie leads the audience to believe it is one thing, when it really is another, being revealed in surprise twists that aren't very surprising.\n\nThe ensemble cast does feature some great performances, even though Henry Cavill's hair is absolutely terrible.

There are so many laugh out loud moments that it makes up for a lot of the flaws. I don't want to spoil the movie, but keep an eye out for the blink and you'll miss it hilarity.\n\nThere are themes explored in this film about motivation, and whether the emotions experienced during life's choices, even when told in the format of a spy thriller, would carry over if you got to do it all over again. Personally, I find that theory worth exploring, because I wonder if I'd make the same good or bad decisions if not exposed to certain stimuli or experiences. Nature vs nurture anyone? People admit that they would love to be able to speak to their younger selves to assure them that things would be better eventually, or to avoid pitfalls, but that's not good enough. One never knows if that would make any difference, unless you take away those moments.\n\nI enjoyed the heck out of this movie overall, and recommend it for the silliness alone.

There is an abundance of CGI and a lot of it is terrible(especially the cat) and it makes the movie look fake but that's the norm these days.

Additionally, John Cena is in this for even less time and it makes me wonder why they even bothered casting him as he must've cost them a fair amount of money for what amounts to a cameo.

Such is the case with director Matthew Vaughn's latest, an action-adventure/comedy about an author of spy novels (Bryce Dallas Howard) who stumbles into a real-life espionage scenario that matches the plot of her latest novel, embroiling her in a web of ever-shifting intrigue with various nefarious parties. The problem here is that the film never quite latches onto a dedicated focus to make the picture work. Some of the comic bits are indeed quite funny, but they frequently get bogged down by a meandering story line that's trying to follow a more conventional, twist-laden thriller format. It leaves viewers asking, \""So what's it going to be?\"" There's also more than a little derivative material thrown in, such as story threads we've already seen before in movies like \""Romancing the Stone\"" (1984), \""The Long Kiss Goodnight\"" (1996) and any number of James Bond flicks. While it's true that this release is intended to be a spoof of these titles (especially in scenes featuring Henry Cavill as a hilariously hammy 007 knock-off), there's a big difference between paying tribute and playing unrepentant copycat. Then there's the picture's excessive length, coming in at a bloated 2:19:00 runtime, far longer than it needs to be, a failing attributable to an often-needlessly complicated plot, one that begins to try audience patience at times, especially in the back half. \""Argylle\"" also features a cute, cuddly cat, Alfie, as a central character (at least in its trailer), but, like the narrative overall, the film doesn't quite seem to know what to do with the supposedly frisky, fickle feline, an impression far different from what's conveyed in the picture's video marketing. All of this is a shame, because this title has both potential and some apparent strengths going for it, such as a fine soundtrack, superbly choreographed action sequences, and an excellent ensemble cast with the likes of Sam Rockwell, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara, Ariana DeBose, and a seriously underused Richard E. Grant, not to mention fine turns from Howard and Cavill as alter-egos of one another. This one isn't nearly as bad as many critics have made it out to be, but it could have been substantially better with some significant retooling and judicious editing. \""Argylle\"" apparently has ambitions to become a new franchise, too, but we'll have to see if that materializes based on what kind of box office draw it ultimately produces.

It was Purr-fect for a movie released in February."", ""Rating"": ""7"", ""Review Content"": ""Packed in a way that is engaging, Argylle offers a story that felt rather simple. But as you went further and further into it, it became something more than that. You will become more intrigued. Your interest in the movie will be better. It will be anything beyond your expectations. They surprise you with the storytelling, it became soooo interesting halfway through the movie. What started as an 'okay' premise turned into something captivating that got really interesting.\n\nThere's a certain appeal we like with the way the story was told. They're good at containing and revealing the surprise elements. They knew how to structure the story. It was exciting knowing that the scriptwriters and directors knew what they're doing. We felt that the script was polished from time to time, tightening loose ends and only when it's ready that they started to greenlight the production.\n\nHowever, the third act felt... a bit too much. The beginning of the story had this blend of normality and ridiculousness. It was a great combination but the second act came in and it got interesting but slightly replicated the world of Kingsman. But came the third act and it was wayyyy too ridiculous, even more ridiculous than Kingsman I would say. The tone just fell apart there. It became too cartoon-ish, we wondered, 'What happened to all the logics they had established in the beginning?'. If only the beginning was a bit more boisterous in its tone, we could have enjoyed more of the third act.\n\nAnother thing that Argylle suffers from is that for a movie this ridiculous, it just doesn't have that much energy to supplement the tone and action portrayed. It became increasingly weirder and ridiculous but the thing is, the energy was flat, if not, increased only mildly. If you felt kinda numb watching the action scenes or you felt that they did everything right but you still felt that something was off or missing, then yeap, it's the energy that's lacking. Kingsman had a vibrant energy and that's what made it a very good film, it jived with the tone of the film. This one, not so much.\n\nIts strong lies in the dynamic of almost every character, particularly the main leads played by Bryce Dallas Howard & Sam Rockwell. These two carried the movie with the support of the whole cast. Bryce and Sam really shined through and through, delivering performances that stay true to what their characters are supposed to suggest to the audience. They are the leads but they don't necessarily have to be charming or elegant. They don't need to be on par with the beauty standards set in Hollywood because their characters just are not meant to be. Personality wise, both of them have different qualities that made their presence strong when together. Their characters really felt out of place to be the leads but it's interesting to have them both put in the situations they're in. Ohhh, and the cat is just sooooo purr-fect.\n\nWhile a lot of characters are interesting, we indeed have a problem with one character. The character played by Samuel Jackson. His character was very flat for someone who seemed very important. It wasn't fleshed out enough. He barely had any screen time that it won't really affect the story if... he's not thereeee? For a great actor to have a minimal role and did him dirty while other characters have more significance in their presence for the story is kinda like an insult.\n\nEven Dua Lipa has more screen time than him! Or so we thought according to our calculation. This movie markets Dua Lipa as the supporting character but rest assured, she's not. If you guess she's here as a cameo, then you're right. Her acting was okay at best, but she's very pleasing to watch. If only we could get more from her, the movie might have been more fun.\n\nThere's a certain cartoon-ish and comical element that comes with the visual effects. But knowing how this movie is going to make us feel and how it's going to look like, the imperfect look just became the right fit for this kind of movie, might even be intentional somehow, that they made the CGI looked exactly the way they appeared to be because it jived with the whole Kingsman-like tone since it's directed by the same guy.\n\nWe also need to give credits where it's due to the people who came with the idea and the people who made it happen. The first 45 mins, especially the train scene has superb transitions. It plays with this element a lot and we could see they had so much fun shooting the scenes. The transitions were hard to do but it was smooth. It's something that amplified its entertainment value and we love it.\n\nWhile the story is packaged and told in a fascinating way, we are not eager to head to the theater for a second viewing. In our opinion, this movie doesn't have the rewatchability factor. It doesn't have the elements to hook us in for a repeat. Action is great but not 'wow' enough. Comedy is there but was pretty bland. There just wasn't anything visually memorable that would want us or we're guessing, most audience for a repeated viewing. The only reason to go again if you'd like to spot all the tiny little details that happened and analyze it better in case you overlooked it during your first viewing. Our advice is, focus on all the little hints this movie is giving you because it is important for the story.\n\nVerdict: What Argylle masters is in its art of crafting its storytelling filled with surprising moments alongside its colourful character dynamics. This Kingsman-like world reflects on and subtly criticizes past action movies tropes in an engaging, somewhat meta manner. Where Argylle lacks is the absurd finale, weak energy and the zilch interest of rewatching it again.

This film is a delightful blend of suspense, humor, and adventure, making it a must-watch for audiences of all ages.\n\nBased on the true story of Mikeal Lindnord (Mark Wahlberg), the movie takes us on a thrilling ride as Mikeal and his group set out to win a race that will go down in history. However, their journey takes an unexpected turn when they encounter Arthur (Ukai), a lovable dog who becomes an integral part of their team.\n\nWhat makes Arthur The King truly special is its ability to resonate with both dog lovers and non-dog lovers alike. The film's visuals are breathtakingly natural, capturing the beauty of the outdoors with stunning cinematography and seamless editing. It's evident that the crew poured their hearts into bringing this true story to life, and their dedication shines through in every frame. Mark Wahlberg's portrayal of Mikeal Lindnord is nothing short of remarkable. He exudes leadership and compassion, especially towards Arthur, which instantly endears him to the audience. Ukai's performance as Arthur adds depth and charm to the film, elevating it to new heights. One of the film's greatest strengths is its pacing. Despite its quick pace, Arthur The King never feels rushed. Instead, it effectively conveys the message of the film - that a dog truly is man's best friend - in a short amount of time, leaving a lasting impact on the audience.\n\nThe message is \""dog is man's best friend\"" and it serves as a reminder of the special connection between humans and dogs.\n\nI give Arthur The King 4 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it for ages 2 to 18, plus adults (and dog lovers.) This film is a heartwarming tale that will leave you laughing, crying, and ultimately feeling uplifted.

Arthur the King caters well to the audience and brings an adorable story to life for just about every person to enjoy across the spectrum of emotions. A fantastically fun and family friendly tale that blends the Hollywood theatrics with a realistic base goes a long way to entertaining folks like me. The setting is gorgeous with camera work to capture the awe and delight of the island race that brings this cast together in ways that help mesh that authentic team/family role. Performances are fun, tight, and hold that Disney level feel, and the dog's inclusion adds even more character and an element that helps the laughs and the near-tears keep flowing. With the editing to further give those perfect shots and sounds, the movie excels in being one of those go see to feel better moments.\n\nDISLIKES:\n\nCliché\n\nCutting Parts\n\nCharacter Development is Mundane At Times\n\nMediocre Antagonists.\n\nPredictable\n\nDislikes are going to be nitpicky and potentially illicit some negative responses, but that's kind of my job. Arthur the King will fall into the cliché role, something critics will find familiar, if not overdone, which leads to them feeling bored and listless. Such predictable antics are slightly off shot, but the trailers have laid the foundation for knowing how most of the story will go, meaning that the surprise element gets a tad diluted. Throw in editing that helps condense the five days into ninety minutes, and part of the adventure is taken away to give you quality of life and your time back. Characters have enough dissection to be engaging, but fall short of the perfect mix, choosing efficiency over meaty profiles. It's not the worst, but it could pack more punch like say Cool Runnings did. Even the antagonists need a little work, a little more connection and involvement to help establish the rivalry that they were going for. There are some other elements I can't say to avoid ruining the little mystery, but the movie being a bit simplistic and maintaining that family feel is going to drop scores for a pickier fanfare.\n\nTHE VERDICT For me, Arthur the King was quite enjoyable and certainly a solid installment in the library of just having fun with a light-hearted story. An incredible dog that did so much with a remarkable team is a solid mixture of just simple enjoyment in a tale with all the elements of movie magic thrown in. Solid performance by all members (especially the dog) will tug at heart strings and athletic stature alike, with editing that brings much of the race's excitement out in spades. True there are some editing choices and character directions that need tweaking, and the movie is very by the numbers in terms of predictability. But outside of that, Arthur the King's story is certainly a tale worth watching, enjoying, and just embracing in the energy and inspiration it puts out in such a tight and fun package. So grab the kids and the family, and get to the theater for this one if you can.\n\nMy scores are: Adventure: 7.5 Movie Overall: 7.0."", ""Upvotes"": ""31"", ""Downvotes"": ""14"", ""Reviewer"": ""rgkarim""}]"

For over 70 years, the article was a subject of political propaganda for the leaders, and it finally ended in 2019 during the BJP's reign. Jambhale's tale gets into the details of the events, which are unknown to many except the ones who were involved in or affected by them. The idea is to give a proper seminar on Article 370's removal, from legality, secrecy, and constitutional loopholes to army operations. The normal audience would have never known them if it weren't for this movie. Jambhale's Article 370 is realistic, somewhat dramatic, and emotionally powerful. Like every other Bollywood film, it also has some issues in the storytelling, but they don't hurt much, even if one has to think about them from a tough critic's point of view.\n\nAs we know, the film is set against the backdrop of the revocation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and the autonomy granted under Article 370 of the Indian Constitution to Jammu and Kashmir-a region administered by India. Zooni (Yami Gautam) kills one of the militants in Kashmir, which leads to her suspension. Soon, she is called back to join a new operation by PMO secretary Rajeshwari Swaminathan (Priyamani). Zooni is given a free hand at the NIA to stop all the terrorist activities in J&K and also the political leaders, including CM, who are playing with the lives of innocent people for the sake of their political propaganda. Nobody can touch them because of Article 370. The Pulwama attack disturbs her, the Prime Minister, and the entire nation, which is followed by a historic, successful air strike. Now, the government wants to end the growing politics and terrorism in J&K by putting an end to the restrictions of 7-decade-old Article 370, which no other party was able to remove. The Prime Minister (Arun Govil) and Home Minister (Kiran Karmarkar) decide to remove Article 370 without opposing the constitutional and legal rights of the citizens. How do they do it? What problems do they have to face? You get to see all these things in the film.\n\nArticle 370 is a well-researched script, but it's too long. The first half takes too long to set up the plot. Maybe because it has to do with the research, prelude, and many other things at ground level. However, the second half picks up very well, with some crowd-pleasing scenes. The last 30 minutes are what make this film a winner in a true sense. The entire bill-passing process is damn interesting and gripping, and it's likely to go viral on the internet. Some may call it political propaganda, but you can't help it if that is what has actually happened. For instance, that Amit Shah's viral speech. We have all seen it in 2019 on National TV, and the representation of that event in this film is surely going to create a lot of noise on the internet. Some scenes are overdramatic, and some scenes are left incomplete-yeah, there are a few mistakes here.\n\nYami Gautam has done a fine job yet again. She is outstanding in that monologue scene while explaining Kashmir's corruption, and what a speech it is. She has another scene to remember, which we have seen in the trailer already: \""Har baar, we have a breakthrough.\"" In short, we have the first standout performance of 2024 by a female actor. Priyamani has a very sophisticated role. She hasn't got any expressive or extreme-level scenes or dialogues, but she has done well enough. Kiran Karmarkar tries to mimic Amit Shah, and it looks funny. But that's entertaining too. Those prosthetics could have been better, though. The same goes for Arun Govil, who plays Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He didn't look like Modi, but he definitely looked like a sophisticated prime minister (of any other country). Iravati Harshe eats up everyone in every single scene of hers. What a performer! Raj Zutshi, Raj Arjun, Skand Thakur, Ashwini Kaul, Vaibhav Tatwawadi, and others have done their part nicely in supporting roles.\n\nArticle 370 doesn't have a big budget, and it didn't need it either. It is a well-made film for its budget, but the technical aspects could have been finer. The VFX part isn't encouraging either. The film has some massy dialogue that will become fan favourites in no time. One of the biggest problems here is the editing. Dividing the film into 6 chapters was not a good idea when only half of them actually held something for the audience. The other three were like documentaries. Article 370 has some overly fascinating and overly dramatic ideas about certain scenes, which don't fit well with the logical reasoning. The analysis was good, but highly confusing. Aditya Jambhale attempts to merge some massy and explosive scenes with the story that hasn't got to do anything with it, but surprisingly, he managed it very well. By the time you finish the film, you don't remember those illogical scenes because, by that time, you have enough new political masala to consume. As a whole, Article 370 seems more like an audience's film than a critic's, so it should find commercial success. It passes the cinematic test on Article 370, which is no less than a UPSC for Bollywood filmmakers in current times. But as an authentic cinema, it could have been better.\n\nRATING - 5/10*"", ""Upvotes"": ""11"", ""Downvotes"": ""33"", ""Reviewer"": ""SAMTHEBESTEST""}, {""Title"": ""Well crafted political thriller"", ""Rating"": ""9"", ""Review Content"": ""Kudos to the young director and producers!

When an existential threat of true AI dominance arises, threatening human extinction, the protagonist bonds with an AI cohort, and fends off the uprising and destroys the AI central threat.\n\nThis movie really wanted to be that movie, except in space with a female lead. There is a real thing in Hollywood: you can steal a story if you change several key aesthetics. So, here we are.\n\nThere are a lot of other problems. The most visible of which is Lopez. She's the kind of actress who some time ago encountered the nadir that many actors do: her status as a celebrity eclipsed her stature as an actress, and she began performing in a very packaged and self conscious way. When you can tell an actor is thinking about how they look in a film, that's not good.\n\nThe other challenges? When a lead performer is as polarizing as Lopez there are many who will \""hate watch\"" this, rubbing their hands together in anticipation of the imminent schadenfreude. And because the plot and dialogue is weak, they'll get their wish.\n\nIt's further complicated that the director, Peyton (Andreas), is familiar enough with spectacle, but not masterful in putting together something that should be of epic scale.\n\nAdd to those obstacles the glaringly apparent lack of originality in the script or character beats, and you have a patient that is Dead On Arrival.\n\nThe script attempts to make the story of AI galactic domination relatable by focusing on Atlas's (Lopez) personal history with betrayal. Unfortunately it throws the entire weight of impending genocide out of orbit. It makes the trials of the protagonist feel small; and Lopez, not looking dirty enough or scarred enough, hits every mark we see coming from a mile away.\n\nMark Strong, Simu Liu and other supporting cast members are saddled with similar story, plot and dialogue problems.\n\nWhat we get is another big splashy Netflix film that will be forgotten in a hurry; to be half-watched while doing chores or sitting on a plane.\n\nBummer."", ""Upvotes"": ""369"", ""Downvotes"": ""205"", ""Reviewer"": ""TMAuthor23""}, {""Title"": ""I was expecting a far worse movie, but I was entertained"", ""Rating"": ""6"", ""Review Content"": ""Seeing Atlas starring Jennifer Lopez pop up on Netflix doesn't necessarily leave you with a lot of hope that it's going to be a good movie, but I surprisingly liked it much more than I expected.\n\nIt may not start off particularly strong, but it gets going and I feel Jennifer Lopez did a better job acting than I expected, and I do remember her doing fairly well at times, like in Out of Sight.\n\nAnyway, it really gets going after about 20-30 minutes, and the action is very well done in my opinion and fun to watch.

Initially, I thought it might be a one-time watch, but its unique content has the potential to be enjoyed multiple times.\n\nA standout performance was delivered by Shantanu Maheshwari as young Krishna.

As a woman of Kidman's own age, I've long admired her ability to navigate Hollywood's often misogynistic demands with grace and intelligence. However, Babygirl plunges headfirst into the cesspool of our cultural decay, trading any semblance of meaningful storytelling for cheap shock value and the crass exploitation of taboos.\n\nThis film is an assault on good taste and decency, a shameless example of the \""pornification\"" of modern media. The plot ostensibly follows Kidman's character, a middle-aged woman caught in a chaotic downward spiral involving a much younger man. What could have been a poignant exploration of age, desire, and power instead devolves into a grotesque spectacle that revels in shock tactics and depravity. Every scene reeks of desperation to provoke, reducing the characters to pitiful caricatures and stripping the story of any emotional depth.\n\nBut the content is only part of the problem. What makes Babygirl even more reprehensible is the way it is packaged and marketed. It drips with a juvenile obsession with provocation and salaciousness, reveling in its vulgarity. This isn't art pushing boundaries with purpose or insight; it's exploitative trash, a film designed to cheapen the conversation rather than elevate it. The film uses taboo relationships, gratuitous imagery, and sensational themes as a crutch, substituting titillation for the nuance and complexity this story could have delivered.\n\nWorse still is the repugnant message the movie sends about women and aging. Nicole Kidman, an actress whose career has been built on intelligence and class, is here reduced to a prop in a tawdry spectacle. At her age-and mine-we deserve stories that reflect our complexities and lived experiences, not ones that demean us or portray us as pathetic and desperate in the name of shock value. Watching Babygirl is an exercise in humiliation for its female audience, and Kidman deserves better.\n\nThe film's fixation on the older woman and younger man dynamic is ripe for thoughtful exploration, but here it's twisted into a grotesque parody. Instead of offering any meaningful insight, the story becomes a vehicle for voyeurism. It's an offensive, outdated stereotype that paints older women as unhinged predators while glorifying the male gaze. The younger male character is a hollow shell, a lifeless pawn in the film's quest for provocation. Watching this dynamic play out is nauseating, a grim reminder of how far we have yet to go in portraying genuine human relationships onscreen.\n\nLet me be clear: no young man, woman, or girl should see this film. Babygirl perpetuates the most toxic aspects of our culture, teaching that shock value is more important than substance, that relationships are devoid of meaning, and that human connection is just a lurid spectacle. For a society already drowning in hypersexualized garbage, Babygirl is gasoline on the fire.\n\nHaving spent decades consuming art that takes risks and challenges societal norms, I know the difference between art that shocks with purpose and trash that shocks for its own sake. Babygirl is firmly in the latter camp. True art unsettles us because it reveals something profound; this film wallows in the gutter, dragging its talented cast and audience down with it. There's no insight here, only cynicism and exploitation.\n\nNicole Kidman's performance is the film's only saving grace, but even she cannot save this disaster. Her talents are wasted on a character so poorly written and devoid of purpose that watching her try to inject life into this role feels painful. The blame lies squarely with a script and direction that prioritize sleaze over storytelling. Watching Kidman in this debacle felt like witnessing a master reduced to performing in a low-budget circus act.\n\nI left the theater not just disappointed but disgusted. This isn't a film that challenges or enlightens; it degrades and diminishes its subjects and its viewers.

As though that's not steamy enough, she finishes up with a kinky encore orgasm in front of her computer screen.\n\nAll this before the opening credits, and the scenes establishing her character Romy Mathis as the founder and CEO of a cutting-edge company that's streamlining Amazon-style commerce with robotics.\n\nWith her successful playwright husband, two beautiful teenage daughters, a corner office with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the Manhattan skyline, a penthouse and a mansion in the country, Romy's got it all. And she rules her domain with aloof, absolute control.\n\nAt least until the intern shows up.\n\nHis name is Samuel (Dickinson) and they meet by accident when he saves her from a savage German Shepherd attack on the sidewalk in front of her office. Later that morning she is formally introduced to the dog whisperer as a member of her company's incoming class of interns.\n\nSamuel stands out of the crowd - at 6-foot-2 he towers over them, actually - but this doesn't explain why Romy can't keep her eyes off the condescending sneer usually on his face. He makes his disregard for her authority clear from the get-go, with the kind of attitude that would a guy fired, pronto, in any corporate setting in anyplace remotely resembling the real world.\n\nInstead, Romy chooses to risk everything she has created and built in her corporate empire and perfect family to get him to practice some of that dog whispering on her.\n\nWhat follows is lots, and lots, of seedy hotel rooms, office desk tops and even a rave, for her to keep discovering how low can she go. Turns out she was faking it in her perfect world. This young-enough-to-be-her-son lover is offering her a way out ... she thinks, and she's willing to commit career suicide to prove it.\n\nLast year Emma Stone won the Oscar and a Golden Globe for her bold foray into sexuality in the brilliant \""Poor Things.\"" She made sex mainstream for awards season.\n\nKidman gets points for guts for following Emma's lead, and for still having an if-you've-got-it-flaunt-it body in her late 50s. But she still comes in a distant second to Stone's groundbreaking performance, which sealed the deal with a healthy sense of humor on the whole subject of sex.\n\nBesides the corporate backstabbing and snake pit treachery, there are themes of fragile family dynamics along with Romy seriously twisted psyche in \""Babygirl.\"" But that's not what the audience has come to see.\n\nUnfortunately, for those of us who never got the concept of power as an aphrodisiac, or are color-blind when it comes to differentiating 50 shades of gray, Reijn's screenplay doesn't make much sense. The eroticism the publicists are banking on gets tedious in a hurry, and would be of even less interest if it weren't Nicole Kidman up there, baring it almost all.\n\nShe remains one of the most versatile actresses on screen today, but \""Babygirl\"" is at best a sideways step rather than a thrilling advance in her brilliant career."", ""Upvotes"": ""124"", ""Downvotes"": ""92"", ""Reviewer"": ""rickchatenever""}, {""Title"": ""Baby Girl needs to go to her room and stay there"", ""Rating"": ""1"", ""Review Content"": ""We have seen this movie done many times, and done so much better. That is the most infuriating thing. This story can be done right with emotion, sensuality, and intensity. This had none of that. What it lacked the most and its biggest downfall; it had zero believability. None with the characters, the plot, or the backstory. There is just one person in this entire journey that you feel for, and you feel for him because of the only decent performance worth mentioning. And even he gets shafted with a horrible story arch before it is all said and done.\n\nThe foundation was intriguing. A brilliant, married, business woman with past drama starts a lurid affair with a young intern. Lifetime built an entire channel around that premise. Nicole Kidman as the lead is also excitable. She is a beautiful, seasoned actress who exudes power. But mother of pearl inlay this was just a squandered use of all of those building blocks.\n\nBaby Girl's story, though understandable, is ultra thin. We get a small glimpse as to how Romy (Nicole Kidman) rose to heights in the business world. It is fuzzy who does what at the company and what if anything takes place there. They bring in a new group of interns including a pompous, mouthy, brat named Samuel (Harris Dickinson). He immediately picks up on Romy's kinks and uses them to somehow manipulate her into risking everything. By this point in the film it is established that Romy has some serious issues when it comes to sex. Either from her past - which is touched on but never really explained - or trying to deal with her powerful position.\n\nThe chemistry between Kidman and Dickinson is void of any sort of magic or allure. We simply do not believe it. And when scenes such as what we get in this movie which live and breath on chemistry, when it is not there, it just becomes sad and laughable. Samuel comes off as a spoiled punk and you sort of hate him from the jump. That makes it even harder to believe that Romy would be the least bit interested in this guy; kink or no kink. She could find better on Google.\n\nAt the heart of this is also Romy's husband (Jacob) Antonio Banderas. Jacob is a loving, patient, caring man who tries his best to understand and come along side Romy. There is no doubt that they have intimacy issues but you get the feeling that they are pushed dwon instead of talked about. Even as he finds out about the affair he is fair and reacts as expected. Banderas is the one person in this film actor and character I could have empathy for. (Side note) - If you get tired of the movie and want to find a way to entertain yourself. Just close your eyes. All the scenes with Banderas now feel like a Puss N Boots movie.\n\nThe biggest disappointment and shocker is that the film is written and directed by a woman. Halina Reijn is a capable film maker on both sides of the camera. If anyone should be able to convey what she wants Romy to convey it is her. If a guy made this film I would get the disconnect. I would tell him to stop trying to get inside a woman's head about these things. But here there is no excuse for what we get from the story and performances.\n\nBaby Girl is rated R for strong sexual content, nudity and language. Even before the first scene comes into focus you know what this movie is about.

Her music was really something. For years she would have just the same repertoire and still it felt more than enough. There was never the need for her to release album after album to stay relevant or influencial in the music industry. Still if the movie used a bit less of the music parts, and developed the others better, the movie would have had a better storytelling.\n\nThe actress is doing a great job portraying the rawness and authencity of Whinehouse even if her looks are more polished, her acting isn't.

She is the nan of Amy (Marisa Abela) and the two have a special bond. Amy lives with her mum who is divorced from her dad Mitch (Eddie Marsan). He fancies himself as a bit of a crooner and she is steeped in jazz, determined to write her own songs and make a success of herself - on her own terms. Enter Nick (Sam Buchanan) who works for music mogul Simon Fuller and she is, after an initial bit of hostility, signed up and on her way.

There's no doubting that many of her songs are great - even if the role of Mark Ronson in any of that is largely ignored, and hats off to Abela for putting her own slant on them. She does her own singing and though she does rather over-egg it, she does imbue a sense of the sheer force of personality this woman had. O'Connell, too, does well enough - especially with his Shangri-La dance in the pub when they meet, but somehow the whole narrative is just too bitty and episodic. The presentation of her character is way too shallow and frankly she is portrayed as a bit of an obnoxious brat. Her increasing exposure to the hounding paparazzi is well illustrated and that growing sense of exasperation obvious, but again we jump around too much as we seem to be rushing to a conclusion we know all about. At two hours it is too long in many ways and too short in others.

The aggression of the photographers seems to receive a disproportionate share of the blame for her predicament whilst rather discounting her own series of bad choices fuelled by her own immaturity and by the public's obsessions with watching what it builds up come crashing down.

Anyway, it was inevitable that we were going to get a fourth (and potentially fifth) as 2020's actual Bad Boys For Life made nearly half a billion dollars and due to the pandemic, was in the top 3 highest grossing of that year.\n\nIt has been too long since I watched the first film (it is long, long overdue a rewatch), however Bad Boys II I return to every couple of years when I require a dousing of Bayhem. Has it aged well? Nope. Is it obnoxious and overlong? Yes. Does the action rule? Hell yes! The third film I found solid, yet disappointing, it lacked the grit and sleaze of its predecessor and incorporated a bizarre supernatural element that didn't quite click.\n\nThis was a real step up from three and balances the slick, modernised lega-sequel of the previous film with the sleaze and chaos of Bay's entries. Admittedly it's a little bit of a rushed and rocky start and narratively the film isn't bringing anything particularly new to the table, yet it's clearly relishing its heightened mid-00's vibes. Once Marcus returns a from death's embrace with a new outlook on life and spirituality and Mike's fears for his family, his own mortality and a reconnection with his fugitive son come to the forefront of his anxieties, the film adds a surprising layer of character work that still manages to incorporate dick jokes and f-bombs aplenty.\n\nAction-wise this boasts some of the franchise's best set pieces. Director's Adil El Arbi & Bilall Fallah certainly lean a bit heavier into the Bayism's here than in BBFL. A slow-motion, sped up and gloriously chaotic digital, neon tinged art exhibition shootout is very Bay. A superb John Wick-esque home invasion shootout (featuring a well deserved triumphant moment for a fan favourite character) and the *entire* finale section of the film is a bar setter for shootouts this year. The incorporation of first person POVs, drones, alligators, explosions aplenty mix together for a riotous bloody blowout.\n\nPerformance-wise this was certainly the best way Will Smith could properly return after the Oscars controversy (I know he had Emancipation a few months after the incident, but I don't think anybody apart from me watched it). His more vulnerable and subdued fatherly moments as Mike are well executed... as well as the kick ass swagger that established the character. However, it's Martin Lawrence that steals the show. A motormouth, wide-eyed, born again foul mouthed spiritual guide who claims he can't die. He's having a ball and both he and Smith's chemistry is still unbeatable. Supporting players Jacob Scipio, Ioan Gruffudd, Rhea Seehorn and Reggie himself Dennis Greene are all locked in to the material.\n\nBad Boys: Ride or Die was a bullet riddled, cackle worthy blast of throwback fun that was a step up from my expectations.

Just because you can fit a camera in a seemingly impossible position doesn't mean you should do it every 3 minutes.

In that sense I might judge it differently than someone who was a fan of the classic, so keep that in mind.\n\nOverall, I had a very good time, and I think the movie is a decent continuation of the cult classic. Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, who I've been a fan of since watching \""Smallville\"" as a child, bring their unique storytelling style to the world of *Beetlejuice* in a movie that is very different from its predecessor, but in a fresh way that also respects the original.\n\nTim Burton, of course, brings his unique style, and this certainly feels like a Tim Burton movie in every sense of the word. The visual effects and production design are beautifully crafted, with that classic feeling of Burton films from the '80s and '90s, but enhanced with today's technologies and more extensive options.\n\nThe acting in the movie was excellent from all parties involved. Michael Keaton, in the iconic role, looks and behaves exactly the same, as if 36 years haven't passed since filming the first movie. Winona Ryder, who has become a much more experienced actress since the original film, leads the film proudly, and the great Justin Theroux is hilariously funny in his unique way. Jenna Ortega, while delivering a good performance, feels a bit overexposed to me in recent years, with the sense that her presence is unavoidable wherever you look. I would love to see her take on a more challenging role that presents a drastically different performance from what she usually does, to justify the hype. Another standout performance in the film was Willem Dafoe's, in an excellent and unconventional comedic role. Overall, the cast is packed with big names that are always a delight to see on screen.\n\nAnother strength of the movie is the musical aspect - something the first movie was very famous for. From a good choice of songs, especially fun \""musical numbers,\"" references to classics from the first movie, and in particular, a slightly different spin on Danny Elfman's iconic and wonderful theme music that will thrill any fan of the classic film.\n\nIn general, while I watched the first movie just recently, it's impossible to ignore the amount of fan service in this movie for fans of the classic film - and I mean that in the most positive way possible. It's not the modern, tiring fan service seen in quite a few franchise movies lately, but rather something that honors the original and gives fans who have been waiting for a sequel what they wanted, doing so in a logical, enjoyable way that remains true to the spirit of the story and what cinema should be.\n\nWhile not a masterpiece or anything of that sort, I had a great time watching this film in IMAX, and I would recommend it to everyone - fans of the original and casual viewers alike."", ""Upvotes"": ""210"", ""Downvotes"": ""101"", ""Reviewer"": ""Dvir971""}, {""Title"": ""Much better than the reviews trashing it.

Most of the original gang in fact is back - Taggart, Rosewood, an unrecognizable Jeffrey and Serge. I've seen BHC 1 & 2 countless times, I can quote them almost verbatim. The third was largely forgettable and a noticeable drop in quality so it was with some trepidation I heard that they were finally going to do a 4th installment. Eddie Murphy had repeatedly said over the years he'll only do it if the script is right but still, I always feared they would modernize it too much and miss the magic of the original.\n\nI'm happy to report they got it mostly right! It was just fun getting to see the characters again on screen after so long. Eddie Murphy slips back into Axel with similar sass and recklessness we remember him as, albeit with a little bit of a softer edge. Judge Reinhold and John Ashton haven't done many (if any) projects in the last 20+ years and they're used sparingly but the scenes with the three of them together just ooze chemistry and if anything I'd have loved there to be more! The new additions to the cast do a solid job too: Kevin Bacon just never disappoints but again, the script could've used him more. Joseph Gordon Levitt does a good job as the straight cop who eventually gets swept up in Axel's plans. We also find Axel has a daughter, Jane, who he's estranged from - it's a bit run-of-the-mill and we don't get too much of a backstory but in truth it's not what this movie is about, that's more of a side-story that gives Axel a bit of an arc to have during the movie. It's not an overbearing part of the plot and it helps give the movie a little extra heart.\n\nThe soundtrack is very well done. It's got all the iconic themes and songs from the original that is just pure nostalgia and it plays such a crucial role in bringing the movie together.\n\nNostalgia was always going to be a big draw for this movie, especially with so much of original cast back. Many movies can get it wrong by being too heavy-handed with it, but here (like Top Gun Maverick) I found it to be spot on; enough to put a smile on your face when you spot the throwbacks, but woven seamlessly enough into the story that it doesn't feel forced.\n\nThey don't shy away from the fact that 40 years has passed, the style of movies (especially comedies) has changed for better or worse, but I think they did an admirable job in trying to make a 2024 action comedy feel like one from the 80s with enough refreshments so it doesn't just feel like a lazy copy yet keeps the charm of the original. It's a really delicate (nigh impossible) balance but they get much more right than wrong. It's quite a bit better than the 1994 third attempt (Joseph Gordon Levitt with a cheeky line in reference to it when he first meets Axel) and I'm glad we get to see the trio reunited one last time for some 80s shenanigans!"", ""Upvotes"": ""196"", ""Downvotes"": ""36"", ""Reviewer"": ""btzarevski""}, {""Title"": ""Welcome back Axel Foley its been a good while"", ""Rating"": ""7"", ""Review Content"": ""The film commences with Axel Foley, now a seasoned Detroit cop, in a high-octane chase through the city streets.

The reappearance of familiar characters like Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) and John Taggart (John Ashton) adds a touch of nostalgia.

Baseless I could have avoided it.\n\nReview of a Disappointing Cinematic Experience\n\nRecently, I had the misfortune of attending a film that, regrettably, turned out to be one of the worst cinematic experiences I have ever encountered. The anticipation leading up to the screening was palpable, but as the film unfolded, it became evident that my expectations were grossly misplaced.\n\nFrom the very beginning, it was clear that the film lacked a coherent storyline. The narrative meandered without purpose, making it difficult for the audience to engage with the plot or connect with the characters. Each scene felt disjointed, lacking the necessary development that typically propels a story forward. Rather than building tension or intrigue, the film seemed content to offer a series of unrelated events that failed to captivate or entertain.\n\nFurthermore, the supposed comedic elements were a significant letdown. Comedy is often a subjective experience, but this film managed to miss the mark entirely. The jokes, if they can even be called that, felt forced and uninspired. It was as if the filmmakers were attempting to induce laughter through mere physical humor-akin to a child engaging in playful tickling-rather than crafting clever dialogue or situational comedy. This reliance on baseless antics only served to alienate the audience further.\n\nThe pacing of the film was another area where it faltered. Scenes dragged on without any real substance, leading to moments of awkward silence that drew attention to the film's shortcomings. Instead of feeling entertained, I found myself checking the time, eager for the film to conclude. The overall experience was tedious, and it was increasingly difficult to maintain interest as the minutes dragged on.\n\nCharacter development, a cornerstone of any good narrative, was virtually nonexistent. The characters were two-dimensional and lacked depth, making it challenging for the audience to empathize with their struggles or triumphs. The lack of relatable or interesting characters left me feeling detached, further diminishing my overall enjoyment of the film. Instead of evolving, the characters remained static, rendering any potential for emotional investment null and void.\n\nMoreover, the film's attempts at humor felt out of place and awkward. Rather than elicit genuine laughter, the comedic moments often resulted in groans of disbelief from the audience. It was as if the writers had thrown together a series of clichés and hoped that one would stick. Unfortunately, none of the comedic elements resonated, leaving the audience in a state of confusion rather than amusement.\n\nIn addition to the weak storyline and poor character development, the film's production quality was also lacking. The cinematography was uninspired, with mundane shots that failed to enhance the narrative or engage the viewer. Sound design, too, was subpar, often drowning out dialogue or failing to create the intended atmosphere. These technical shortcomings further compounded the film's inability to deliver a satisfying viewing experience.\n\nAs I sat in the theater, I couldn't help but reflect on how much more enjoyable my time could have been had I chosen a different film. The experience was so underwhelming that I ultimately decided to leave midway through the screening, a decision I do not take lightly.

Channing Tatum, Christian Slater, The legendary Kyle MacLachlan and many more. Above all, Naomi Ackie manages to carry the film in an amazing way, with a captivating, impressive, and very charismatic performance. Since the movie has so many plot twists, it's difficult to praise the other performances without getting into spoilers, but I can only say that the impressive cast does a really successful job here.\n\nIt's truly surprising to think that this is the first film Kravitz has written and directed because it feels like the work of a very experienced and talented screenwriter and director. The movie is made and structured very well, and it seems that during her years as an actress, she learned a lot from the people she worked with, and her debut film is far from looking like the first film of a filmmaker. A very professional job from all angles. If she continues in this direction, I see great achievements in her future.\n\nAlthough the film is a psychological thriller, Kravitz managed to blend the genre with a lot of humor. There are several moments in the film that will surely shock many viewers, especially with the way they come out of nowhere, and the fact that they are flanked by humorous scenes on both sides is quite unusual, reminiscent of early Guy Ritchie films or even Quentin Tarantino's extreme dark humor.\n\nThe film's length is very compact, and I feel that its pacing was just right. Although it took a little too long to \""get into things,\"" the tension and mystery are built very effectively throughout the film, keeping the viewer on the edge of their seat, eager to see and know more. Additionally, the very ending of the story feels a bit odd and even slightly rushed, containing two or three holes and points that raise questions (\""how and why did this happen if such and such?\"").\n\nThe soundtrack, as minimalist as it is, it adds a lot of atmosphere. Less is more, in this case. Additionally, the sound editing in the film was very impressive and added to the atmosphere of tension that the movie tries to build from the very first moment. The cinematography is also very impressive, and in general, this film feels very high-quality in its technical aspects.\n\nIn my opinion, this is one of the most surprising and entertaining films of the past year. I really enjoyed watching it, but it's important to come prepared for a pretty wild film that's completely without restraint. On the one hand, the movie is full of humor, but on the other hand, expect some pretty harsh things to watch.

The movie follows Frida, a young middle class woman invited to a tech billionaire's private island. What starts out as a romantic luxurious getaway quickly turns into a seriously messed-up experience filled with memory loss, mind games, and a whole lot of dark satire.\n\nKravitz proves she's got skill behind the camera, delivering a movie that looks great and balances humor with some very tense moments. The cast is solid, the dialogue's sharp, and there's plenty of cool visuals that keep you hooked. Kravitz is definitely more than just an actor trying out directing-she's got skills to back it up.\n\nBut here's the thing, despite all the style, Blink Twice stumbles under its own weight. The plot tries to tackle way too much in too little time-toxic masculinity, trauma, white privilege, cancel culture-you name it, it's in there. Because of that, the story gets messy, losing some of its impact. The pacing drags with repetitive scenes and foreshadowing that's so on-the-nose it almost spoils itself. By the time the big twist rolls around, you've probably already guessed it, and it doesn't hit as hard as it should. The ending undermines the faux feminist message that left me almost as disappointed as Saltburn. That is only the tip of the thematic issues... but someone more knowledgeable on theory should delve into it deeper.\n\nIf you've seen movies like Glass Onion, Triangle of Sadness, The Menu, or Don't Worry Darling, this one's gonna feel familiar. That's both good and bad-it's got a bit of that same vibe but also feels a little stale, even though it starts off strong. Had it come out ten or so years ago it'd be a phenomenon.\n\nStill, Blink Twice isn't without its moments. It's got style, for sure, and Kravitz's dark tone might just help it pick up a cult following. The movie tries to flip into slasher mode in the third act, which sorta works, though as a horror snob I kind of wanted more grit and gore. Horror fans might dig it, but don't expect it to blow you away or come out feeling better.\n\nIt's clear that Blink Twice is well-made, but it's also very unpleasant. Watching it, I felt deeply unsettled and incredibly anxious. It effectively drew me into the fantasy alongside the characters. Zoe Kravitz shows she's got a future as a director, and maybe with a bit more focus, a sequel could really deliver.

Like most of these movies, I know very little about the real life figures being portrayed and if I only had this movie to go off I would be completely dumbfounded as to why any of these events were worth being depicted on film.\n\nThe whole thing just feels totally flat and without life. Kingsley Ben-Adir is fine but usually the one thing I can usually count on with these movies is outstanding acting but the script here didn't give him much to work with and it comes across in his performance. Rather than presenting an actual depict of this person, the whole thing just feels like the expected snapshots of Marley's career and life and it's so scattershot in it's execution that nothing the character does has much of any impact. Even something as simple as seeing him perform for the first time just comes and goes without any sort of impact and the story itself didn't serve the legend that Marley was any better.\n\nI appreciate the fact that the film didn't go with the cradle-to-grave structure but it still took a very expected and uninspired approach. After some very badly inserted text, it seems to be established that the whole thing is going to revolve around the build up to one concert but that's mostly done away with within the first 30 minutes. After that the whole thing just chugs along at a totally meandering pace full of bland montages and eye rolling family drama that just makes the entire film feel unfocused. That's in large part due to bad editing and also fairly uninspired work behind the camera.\n\nThe whole technical approach feels totally defunct and it never really felt like Renaldo Marcus Green or the writers decided what they wanted to say about this man's life and legacy. The film drops us into the middle of Marley's career without any kind of indication as to why he became such a phenomenon or how he came to be the way he is and because of that I was never that invested in the journey the film tries and fails to take him on. There's also a lot of political and social elements at play in this script that are supposed to motivate Marley and none of it feels tangible. The few moments of social upheaval we see are few and far between and even then they're executed it a totally uninteresting way that totally rob them of effectiveness. The film also ends before Marley can actually accomplish much of anything so the whole narrative just ends up feeling like a prolonged first act.\n\nI always thought that something like Bohemian Rhapsody would be the worst thing to come out of the musical biopic phenomenon but I actually think I'd rate that movie over One Love. Because for all that films faults, and it has too many to list here, I at least thought it did some justice to the legendary status of Queen as well as having some genuinely riveting concert sequences. This film not only totally fails at presenting an interesting portrait of its title character but it's also totally un-engaging as a viewing experience. I'm not going to claim to be an expert on Marley or his music but even as a passive admirer I am still totally aware at how much this film doesn't do his legacy justice.

Kingsley Ben-Adir encapsulated Marley to the letter. It hit the right notes with Marley's relationship with his wife Rita and his passion for music and his people. Plus, the weight he carried being an iconic music figure to most Jamaican people, and an irritant to those who saw him as sort of a sellout. Go see the film for yourself because critics would lead you to believe this film is subpar and it isn't. It introduces a younger generation to Marley and his music, and it reintroduces him to those who experienced his personal greatness and his music first-hand. I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and when I got home, I popped on some Marley tunes."", ""Upvotes"": ""46"", ""Downvotes"": ""39"", ""Reviewer"": ""syd9907""}]"

This movie truly was not \""important\"" enough to tell it over 131 minutes. Add to that there were pointless extended shots that you were begging to end. At about 100 minutes in, audience members were looking at their cellphones either to check the time or they were getting restless.\n\nSecond, there were excessive timeline jumps. It is often a useful story-telling device, but here it was excessive and distracting - so much so that when they did another timeline jump there was a consensus \""groan.\"" Making matters worse, is that there were time jumps as long as 13 years. However, Zendaya --- bless her heart --- as much as they tried to \""age\"" her and \""de-age\"" her through hair and make-up, she never looked, to me, older than about 17 years old regardless of the time era.\n\nThird, while I credit Zendaya for tackling such a meaty role, and as much as I otherwise adore her, she just simply seemed to young to be so \""weathered\"" and \""jaded\"" and \""cynical\"" and \""ruthless\"" and \""calculating\"" as she was. Further, I really don't remember her smiling once throughout the movie. And as I have read in other reviews, she seemed to have a resting \""scowl\"" throughout the movie - ironically very much similar to the scowl she had throughout both Dune 1 and 2.\n\nAnd lastly, by the end of the movie, none of the three characters were likeable, and, perhaps, oddly, sadly, Zendaya was, to me, the least likeable. And from a film character study point of view, the viewer is never given a reason or backstory for this.\n\nWith all these distractions in mind, I was so eager for the movie to end that I lost all investment whatsoever in who won or lost in the story's big moment."", ""Upvotes"": ""959"", ""Downvotes"": ""240"", ""Reviewer"": ""ztpbrmhw""}, {""Title"": ""Only works for fans of Zendaya"", ""Rating"": ""Not Found"", ""Review Content"": ""Forget Match Point, even Paul Bettany's Wimbledon is better. If you are not a fan of Zendaya, I would never reccomend this \""movie\"" to anyone. It lacks absolutely everything but occasional beautiful scenery.\n\nI remember Zendaya since Shake It Up and although she is a smart and lovely woman with indeniable star quality, her acting has never been convincing. She always positions herself perfectly for the shot, has the needed movement or expression, but it is always with more connection for the camera than with the character (even in Euphoria). I also never found her use of her voice adequate, it is usually one note. It sort of works here because Tashi is a character as flat as a pancake.\n\nThe two other leads are no better and it is an already very far fetched idea that they would attract the attention of anyone, let alone of someone like the Tashi character.\n\nAnd if this was a movie to attract tennis fans... well it won't. None of the tree leads looks like they have ever played sport. Any sport, any kind, not professionally, just any at all. In school, in the backstreet with friends. The director is either very incapable of his job or hasn't either. They hired Brad Gilbert to consult and help. Ok, but he helps with the wrong aspects. In the end of the day a general viewer would not care if the serve technique is correct, or if the movement and speed is accurate. But he would care about the absolute lack of any engagement with the game. No passion, no desire, no will, no care. Even Ivan Lendl has visibly shown more connection to the game and he was infamous for cool attitude. Or Andre Agassi or Nick Kyrgios who have stated many times they hated tennis. These actors look and act like they are trying not to trip, not to make a wrong move and not like playing for anything (not just the tenmis aspects of the movie). And from this there is no loud enough music to make you care about their game or desires.\n\nThe music is terrible allthrough, loud and without having any connection with the supposed story. The overly in your face \""metaphors\"" are just tiring at this point. Filmmakers might wanna try some new and fresh approach to get the point across.

Just scan the User Reviews. I think if you are a fan of either Zendaya or director Guadagnino, you will find no fault in this movie. Those reviews are all the 8-10 ones you see here.\n\nPersonally, I found the movie incredibly slow-paced, driven by a poorly constructed story with characters I cared nothing about. The first 15 minutes dragged, but when they did the flashback to when Tashi, Art, and Patrick first met, I thought there might be some potential. There was an attempt at character-building. But then the movie continued to jump back and forth in time to explain how we ended up where the movie began, with no effort to delve deep into any characters.\n\nThe script felt like a first draft. There was potential for an excellent story about how Tashi used and played Art and Patrick against one another to advance her life and career. But there are no key events to truly drive the plot. We just jump around in time to show their failed relationships.\n\nI also found the acting dreadful, especially Zendaya. None of the leads can emote anything, possibly due to the poor script or directing. Most lines are delivered flat and monotone. The movie also lacks humor and joy, other than the first flash back scene.\n\nMany scenes are also drawn out way too long, with throbbing techno music and slow motion. I constantly found myself looking at my watch or hoping there was a remote control so I could skip ahead 10 seconds. They could have easily removed 20 minutes from the final edit with no impact to the story. The last 10 minutes were truly awful.\n\nThe whole homoeroticism aspect also falls flat. Art and Patrick can shove churros in each other's mouths as much as they want, but there is nothing else about their relationship to think either is completely heterosexual. It's like the director had to throw this in to be edgy. Ditto with the locker room and sauna scene.\n\nI also found the tennis action disappointing. I give the director credit for attempting something different by showing the action as if the player had a Go-Pro on their head or if the ball were the camera. But none of it works. There is no excitement or tension in any of the points played. And all of the full-frame shots of the actors swinging a racket obviously use a CGI ball.\n\nAnd don't get me started on the ending. Everyone in the theater burst out laughing. And they were laughing AT the ending, not WITH the ending. I didn't hear a single compliment from people leaving the theater.\n\nSo, in summary, if you love Zendaya or Guadagnino you may enjoy this movie. Otherwise, wait for it to hit streaming.

A cliché story of an underdog trying to become a champion in some obscure sport (which they failed to properly explain).

The lead actor, who seemed like he was pulled out of an amateur theatre workshop, displayed a range of expressions varying from confused to constipated. His attempts at emoting were so cringe-inducing that I started rooting for the villain, who was equally unimpressive with his over-the-top evil laughs and cartoonish gestures.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the music.

I've seen better CGI in YouTube videos made by teenagers in their basement. The scenes meant to be action-packed were just plain laughable.

Like soldiers in a war of attrition, they must constantly reassess the purpose of thier risks and sacrifices as they watch their colleagues fall for the sake of the priceless pictoral story of war.

I have to stress that OH MY GOD you have to see this on the big screen! It's one of the most immersive films I've ever seen-I wasn't pulled out of it for even a second and it is so bloody beautiful!\n\nI should not have loved this movie, but I did, because it has some truly wild universal implications-it's not limited to the US at all. I had to take a long time to process this film, but I understand the breathless first reactions: this is not like anything I've seen before, for one particular reason. I also totally get the Apocalypse Now comparisons: now there's another film that contradicted each impulse it put out. One might say that by nullifying itself it too was \""empty\""-but of course it wasn't. This movie is pretty meta: what I think and say will say a lot about me and how I see the world. That's super cool! But it's not about war (outside of being an anti-war film). It's about war journalism, and spectacle.\n\nA lack of context might annoy people. And why? Well, frankly, because this is a movie that is opposed to American exceptionalism. It aggressively shoves your face in its sameness actually. It renders it banal; a war zone like any other country in another war film where most American viewers likely have little idea of the opposing parties or actors involved. Every gun shot is loud as hell, every explosion is far too much: spectacle, yes, and people ask \""to what end?\"" I find it radical. One can make up five different backstories of how Texas and California seceded separately and then allied against a fascist President: but the only reason you'd have a problem with the fact that Civil War doesn't tell you is because you're too attached to the American-ness of it all. America? Depicted like any other? The cheek! Jesse Plemons' character heavily evokes the Khmer Rouge. There's so many other examples-they remind you of somewhere else (Vietcong references, Afghanistan/Iraq imagery, less domestic parallels than international ones tbh). I admire the provocation to us Americans, I really do. This film is about the spectacle of war and how it would look today: literally any war, anywhere, and here! And it's using the most provocative, iconic setting to do that.\n\nThe performances are OFF THE WALL. Dunst is phenomenal, she's the whole-ass movie! We've literally never seen this from her before, and damn, that range. One doesn't doubt her as Lee, a veteran war photographer, for a moment, even though she barely says anything. It's saying a lot that this is up there amongst her best work. Hell, it's one of the best performances of this whole decade. The whole movie plays out through her reactions and tonally she's pitched it perfectly. And Wagner Moura is almost equally brilliant (it could reasonably be considered a co-lead performance imo): his Joel is chaotic, wild, and hedonistic. The depiction of war journalists is so precise: the bizarre, adrenaline-fueling addiction that it seems to require. It's devastating. The film explores the ethics of reporting: where it ends is not stated, but it is clear. In Moura's scream, in Dunst's eyes, in Stephen McKinley Henderson's beautifully wise tone, and then in Spaeny's reverse-mirroring her idol's journey. The score was appropriately surreal, the needle-drops brilliant (deep cuts!), all the techs are undeniably in sync. None of this would've worked without this ensemble, and Dunst in particular. They're not just the characters: they're the whole point of the film.\n\nOne might ask: How stupid does Alex Garland have to be to make a film so pointedly open to all the criticism? He knows people will call it \""empty\"", lacking in a \""political stance.\"" He knows people will find it bombastic, or that because we're thrown into the deep end, no amount of character shading and performance work will prevent people from saying things like \""thin characterization\"". But Lee, Joel & Sammy (McKinley Henderson) are razor-sharp. Jessie (Spaeny) is the real enigma. I think for Garland, this setting was the only vehicle through which there might be an actual jolt, and he wasn't wrong. The setting is familiar *globally*: what better setting to choose than the icons of a global superpower most people in the world are familiar with? This might seem like a step too far as comparison but people across the world were just as shocked as anyone when the towers went down on 9/11. Why? Because they wondered: it could happen there too? Really?! Garland's somehow made a film that feels real enough to evoke that shock.\n\nI kept thinking with every second I would soon say it's exploitative. But this movie doesn't allow any feel-good triumphalism. It's dark & terrifying. This is the sheer dread and despair of war: there is no questioning that the film is staunchly anti-war: the cost of it all feels so palpable. The aesthetic of this film and the strong emotion it elicits-all clearly intended-is more than enough for me to run with. I would've definitely been annoyed if it had been too definitive.

And typically, I wouldn't mind this expectation subverting style, as long as the movie had a tight, taut script, interesting and nuanced characters, refined performances, and a riveting plot. \""Civil War\"" has none of these things.\n\nA24 has a reputation for publishing thought-provoking, artistic pictures that - yes - subvert audience expectations. More than that, A24 films typically have razor sharp scripts and humanistic dialogue that draws viewers into the world, engrossing them in the (often brutal) struggle of the characters that are inhabiting the screen. And oh, how I wish that \""Civil War\"" followed this trend that A24 has been so consistent in practicing.\n\nDirected by Alex Garland, \""Civil War\"" both looks and sounds great. With sound design that sends shockwaves down theatre seats, each and every gunshot borders on deafening to the point where I saw my fellow movie goers covering their ears at points; needless to say, it's effective, adding a certain intensity to the action scenes that is simply missing from other, even more expensive, action films. And from a visual perspective, \""Civil War\"" is a pretty film (a forest fire sequence is especially striking) that also isn't afraid to immerse viewers in the type of grotesque imagery that one would expect from a movie that is depicting a modern-day war torn America. From street bombings to point blank executions, this isn't an easy movie to watch from a thematic standpoint, but man, it sure is easy to look at with the type of lush visuals you'd expect from an Alex Garland film. And if you're coming for action, you'll get it... kind of. The last act is, frankly, mind blowing, following a prolonged action sequence that is certainly exciting, albeit disturbing given the context of, well, a civil war in America. That said, the build up to this sequence is full of, honestly, not much.\n\nStarring Kirsten Dunst as a wartime photojournalist, \""Civil War\"" follows Kirsten and her merry band of psychopa- sorry, of photographers, as they road trip from one atrocity to the next, taking snapshots with the tenacity and glee of a TMZ reporter. Kind of echoing the Jake Gyllenhaal film \""Nightcralwer,\"" in \""Civil War,\"" Kirsten dons the same blank, lifeless expression as she photographs dead people, dying people, and people who are about to die. Her colleagues do the same thing with varying levels of enthusiasm - some are at first disgusted at the sight of violence, while others literally proclaim \""What a rush!\"" after a fire fight. Many seem to think this film is a glorification of journalism, but I disagree; mostly every character is un-empathetic to the extreme, bordering on inhuman, as they photograph atrocities and never once think to themselves, \""Huh, maybe I should step in and help.\"" So on one hand I understand what Garland was trying to say; on the other hand, the characters were so unlikeable that I absolutely hated watching them.\n\nHowever, and as I mentioned, the film \""Nightcrawler\"" deals with similar themes - the difference is that movie is well acted, and extremely well written. On the contrary, \""Civil War\"" is just bland. The performances are mostly all one note, and the dialogue is so, so silly, with every character acting so unrealistic that I couldn't help but roll my eyes with every word that exited their mouth and with every action they took that no one in their right mind would take. Characters act so silly, and their dialogue is so ridiculous, that it's a wonder they've survived so long in the world they're inhabiting. And it's a shame, because where this movie truly had to shine to succeed was in its characters and script, and both of those things are just not up to par.\n\nThis review is a little too long winded at this point, so I feel like it's time for me to quit writing and simply say that \""Civil War\"" is not a mainstream movie, and that's okay. What's not okay is the fact that the movie is full of boring characters, boring dialogue, and a boring plot. The sound design and visuals are incredible, in typical Garland fashion; the rest of the movie is just kind of there.

It feels like it's been a while since we had a good old fashioned serious-minded, tension-packed, \""big\"" drama film featuring big movie stars. Well, that's exactly what director Edward Berger, fresh off his Oscar-winning ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT (2022), serves up with his latest. Writer Peter Straughan (TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY, 2011) has adapted the 2016 Robert Harris novel, and the result is a welcome crowd-pleaser that may garner some Oscar consideration.\n\nRalph Fiennes delivers what may be his best performance yet. And that's saying something for the much-respected actor who has previously excelled in such films as SCHINDLER'S LIST (1993), THE CONSTANT GARDNER (2005), IN BRUGES (2008), A BIGGER SPLASH (2018), and THE MENU (2022). His impressive career is only enhanced by this most recent role of Cardinal Lawrence, saddled with the heavy burden of facilitating the titular Conclave charged with electing the new Pope. As the film opens, the beloved Pope has just passed ... and as they say, \""let the games begin\"". Of course, these games are all about political maneuverings and power struggles and backroom promises. Director Berger opts to show us very little of the actual negotiations, and instead puts the various iterations of loyalty on display during each successive secret (of course) vote.\n\nWithin the confined walls of Vatican City and the Sistine Chapel, Cardinal Lawrence's time is mostly spent investigating tips, scolding others for their behavior, and dealing with the immense egos of the few being considered (including himself). Stanley Tucci plays Cardinal Bellini, who pretends to not want the job while campaigning as the 'progressive' voice the church needs now. John Lithgow is Cardinal Tremblay, one of the most assertively ambitious who may or may not have purposefully undermined the work of another. Either way, Lucian Msmuati's Cardinal Adivemi is the victim of Tremblay's actions. Cardinal Tedesco, portrayed by Sergio Castellitto, is the most outspoken in his desire to return the church to the old ways (Latin masses forever!), what he sees as proper. Bryan F O'Byrne plays O'Malley, assistant to Lawrence, and yet, despite all of these men, it's Isabella Rossellini as Sister Agnes who manages to shoot (figurative) fire from her eyes, while maintaining her 'place' and significantly impacting the process. She is stunning and memorable in her limited role.\n\nEarly on, a big surprise arrives in the form of Cardinal Benitez (Carlos Diehz) of Kabul, who was the most recent appointee by the previous Pope, and unknown to the others. As a novel, this may be a real page-turner, and yet the movie never rushes from one moment to the next. Tension builds with each revelation and tarnished robe and secretive plot. Although the film barely skims the years-long sexual abuse scandal in the church, there is a stream of twists and turns that keep us on our toes as the Cardinals are sequestered. It's fascinating to see how cinematographer Stephane Fontaine keeps things visually interesting in an enclosed environment filled with characters who aren't allowed to go anywhere else. Another aspect I truly appreciated was the unusual musical score composed by Oscar winner Volker Bertelmann. This is the type of movie which often features overbearing music to 'enhance' tension, yet Bertelmann's notes are effective jabs at just the right times.\n\nPower plays, corruption, and political stunts are all present as these Men of God bungle the process of picking their next leader. Importance of the mission and tradition pale in comparison to ego and self-interest. The symmetry to U. S. politics is unmistakable and surely a purposeful approach by Berger. The final twist may be a bit out of proverbial left field, but in a room filled with secrets, perhaps that's as it should be. To balance the tension and seriousness, anyone paying attention will appreciate the subtle humor, especially as it plays out as these relics muddle through modern day situations (technology, social progressiveness, terrorism). This is certainly not a film created for Catholics only, although for a brief moment, I worried we might have one that could be subtitled, \""The Catholic Crying Game\"". Fortunately, it's one with a tension-filled story, terrific visual shots, a perfect score, and superb acting ... a fun movie to watch.\n\nOpening in theaters on October 25, 2024."", ""Upvotes"": ""170"", ""Downvotes"": ""73"", ""Reviewer"": ""ferguson-6""}, {""Title"": ""Went way to far with ending"", ""Rating"": ""1"", ""Review Content"": ""If you're a Christian or Catholic don't waste your time or money.

However, the film never quite reaches its full potential. Despite featuring a star-studded cast and a promising concept, it struggles to soar due to its lackluster execution.\n\nOne aspect that shines is the trio of leading ladies.

With three gorgeous ladies in the lead and never-seen-before aerial heist drama, this Kareena Kapoor, Tabu, and Kriti Sanon starrer was expected to fly high and even took off on a decent note, but unfortunately, the flight couldn't land safely. There was some unrepairable turbulence in the second half that took this exciting heist comedy down. A few comic punches worked because of adult humour and urban touches, but were they enough? Frankly, no, but they do pass on some good laughs. This Crew needed a better pilot, better training, and better study material than what it has to fly high. Let's say, air traffic jammed it.\n\nSo, Crew can be called a wannabe parody of Vijay Mallya's scam, as here we have Vijay Waliya (Saswata Chatterjee), the owner of Kohinoor Airliner. We have three super hot air hostesses: Divya Rana (Kriti Sanon), Jasmin (Kareena Kapoor), and Geeta Sethi (Tabu), who are not getting paid enough and are struggling to get a respectable income. After trying all the right and honest ways of life, these three finally decide to join the dishonest gang at once by smuggling gold from India to the Middle East. Sooner or later, they were supposed to get caught, but what happens when they are looted by a rich man? These three must gang up to get what was \""ours,\"" even though you have to turn a plain comedy into a heist comedy for that.\n\nNidhi Mehra and Mehul Suri's Crew has a decent first half, but things crash down heavily in the second half. Parodying Vijay Mallya and his scam was okay; it was somewhat funny, but trying to capture him and seize gold was too much. The concept goes terribly wrong, and there are reasons for it. In the first half, you relate to the story because you can feel the struggle of those three ladies and their friends (crew members). However, the second half is not about them, so you lose all the connection and all the interest in the story.\n\nIt's okay to take inspiration from The Italian Job and Oceans Eleven, but you don't have to drag those ideas into your fictional parody world by saying that it's all done for society's sake. The second half of Crew is full of loopholes. More holes (windows) than any plane can have. Nidhi and Mehul's sarcastic attempt at urban comedy is praiseworthy, but the comical sense was cheap. Nobody cares what's happening in the personal lives of those three ladies because they haven't had an inspiring or stable life. For instance, Divya (Kriti Sanon) is a topper, a sports champion, and always ready to fight the wrongs. She scares the hell outta referee for his wrong decision-that's more like it. But what happens to this smart, intelligent, and honest girl in the very next moment when she has quick sex with a stranger without any hi, hello, or even a formal introduction (forget love)? I never saw a dead man having a boner after death (almost after 10 minutes). You can't be serious, man. This is some next-level crap.\n\nI must say, Crew has plenty of glamour. Tabu hasn't been doing glamorous roles lately, except for De De Pyaar De, but here, she gets a complete new makeover. What a sexy makeover she has got here! The best and most aggressive dialogues also go into her kitty. Kriti Sanon is \""Kali\"" (bud). She is young, dashing, and sexy, and she looks damn confident as an air hostess. Kareena gets into her Bebo mode again. Only this time around, you have to see her antagonising a few things. But then, she also has a few emotional scenes. Trupti Khamkar has done a fantastic job and will surely get your appreciation. Rajesh Sharma was a bit irritating in some scenes with those fake laughter and expressions, and the same goes for Saswata Chatterjee. I never could have imagined these two senior actors being wasted like this. Kapil Sharma had a sensible role, but with low screen time. Diljit Dosanjh has a somewhat interesting role, which isn't elevated well enough.\n\nAnil Kapoor and Ekta Kapoor have spent a nice budget on the lavish scale and look of the film. The costumes are exquisite, the locations are gorgeous, and the production design looks beautiful. Anuj Rakesh Dhawan's close-up shots of the three leading ladies are stimulating, but sometimes they expose the make-up they are wearing. That's scary. The music is tappy, as \""Choli,\"" \""Naina,\"" and \""Ghagra\"" set the party mood right. Rajesh Krishnan's direction skills see a dip in quality compared to what he has done in Lootcase and Tripling, but more than him, it's the script that deserves to be blamed. Krishnan's over-the-top jokes can still take multiplex audiences on a roll, but they may not get enough support from the masses. Crew is a little screwed-actually very much screwed-in the second half, but there are some scenes that give you a little pleasure of new-age female-driven comedy.

Just not consistently the way I hoped for as it only lasted up to a certain point, and then it dropped the ball. Suddenly it felt like the movie didn't know what it wanted to be, as it went in different moods and directions.\n\nIt did try to get back on the creepy track here and there, but it was not enough. The illusion of a really creepy and eerie setting was over, and the rest was a rather bland mix of pointless motions which had me simply waiting for the end of the movie so I could go and do something else. It's a shame, I wanted it to keep on the way it initially did. That would have set it apart from other horror movies, but alas no, it wasn't meant to be.

The thing about not knowing what the evil really is, not knowing where it came from, that's a great part of the horror it represents. The fear of the unknown is as old as all living things and should not be ruined when making these movies. Once you explain it, it's over. How copywriters and directors misses this point again and again in movie after movie is completely beyond me. If you can avoid it, don't show the monster, but if you do, make sure it gets maximum effect and not for shock value.

I really enjoyed the addition of Joey King as Poppy Prescott as one of the the neighbor characters to the Gru Family. I liked the fact that the Gru Family has to figure out how they need to adapt to a new neighborhood. I really enjoyed the journey that Gru goes on with his infant son Gru Jr. Where at the beginning of the movie, Gru Jr. Hates his father and then eventually starts to like his father at he end of the movie. And finally, the minions are still a lot of fun with their insane antics.\n\nMixed for Despicable Me 4 (2024): The main issue that I have with this movie is the screenplay and that's primarily because the two screenwriters of this movie are Mike White, the creator of The White Lotus (2021-) and Ken Daurio, the screenwriter of multiple Illumination Animated Movies. And while I do enjoy what both of these guys bring to the table with their writing, their styles of writing do not feel compatible with each other in term of how they write their characters, construct their stories, the tone that they're going for and the themes that they want to explore. It literally feels the movie is trying to figure out what it wants to be throughout the runtime.\n\nNegatives for Despicable Me 4 (2024): Similar to Despicable Me 3 (2017), Dr. Nefario is not in this movie, with the exception of a small cameo. And finally, the villains of both Maxime Le Mal and Valentina are by far the weakest in the franchise which is bizarre because they are voiced by Will Ferrell and Sofia Vergara respectively.\n\nOverall, Despicable Me 4 (2024) is still a fun movie within this franchise but we've reached the point where this franchise is starting to feel played out and that's not a good thing."", ""Upvotes"": ""71"", ""Downvotes"": ""11"", ""Reviewer"": ""jared-25331""}, {""Title"": ""Banana"", ""Rating"": ""10"", ""Review Content"": ""Despicable me 4!

They should've been in it so much more instead of being relegated to a small handful of scenes.\n\nChris Renaud's direction certainly gives the film a lot of energy with the hyperactive pace which can barely stay still.

Waking up early and without telling her husband, Iris makes her way to her son's memorial in the park intent on jumping off the same cliff only to be stopped by an engagement with a seemingly well-intentioned stranger named Richard (Finn Wittrock) who tells her his own experience of loss with his girlfriend Chloe causing the two of them to walk back to their cars together. However once there Richard reveals himself to be a serial killer and kidnaps Iris knocking her unconscious. Thanks to a Swiss Army knife Iris manages to make Richard crash the car and escape only to be informed by Richard he's injected her with a paralytic agent that will work its way through her system over the next 20 minutes rendering her completely immobile.\n\nDon't Move is the new Netflix thriller produced by Sam Raimi and directed by Adam Schindler and Brian Netto who are no strangers to working with Raimi having directed Grey Cloud Island (Minnesota) for Raimi's Quibi anthology series 50 States of Fright as well as collaborating on their own solo projects like Netto's Delivery: The Beast Within or Schindler's Intruders. The film was announced in 2022 with a script by Schindler's Intruders scribes T. J. Cimfel and David White with shooting commencing in 2023 with Netflix acquiring distribution rights the following year. Don't Move doesn't reinvent the wheel when it comes to this kind of \""cat and mouse\"" thriller, but it utilizes the format effectively to generate palpable tension thanks to brisk efficient direction and an engaging heroine and villain.\n\nIf I were to compare Don't Move to something, I'd probably say the best comparison is a serial killer version of the movie Red Eye from 2005. Much like how that film was built around the tension and chemistry generated between Rachel McAdams and Cillian Murphy, a similar effect is achieved between Asbille and Wittrock. Kelsey Asbille does well playing a grieving mother who feels trapped by the world following the death of her son and it's incorporated well into her struggle for survival that gives her an arc for being able to live again. On the opposite side we have Finn Wittrock (who I mainly know from season 4 of American Horror Story before I stopped watching) who is very good as the man calling himself \""Richard\"" whose good looks and charismatic charm are nicely contrasted with the darker nature that reveals itself and creates a terrifying character who can bend and twist reality on the fly to meet his ends. In terms of mining a feature length ride from the central premise of character being paralyzed I'll admit I was more than a little skeptical as while it's a terrifying idea it's incredibly difficult to stretch to feature length especially when purposefully limited (such as 2007's Awake which went to some inexplicable areas in its usage of Anesthesia awareness). Despite the challenges inherent in working with such a concept, Cimfel and White's screenplay does well in creating high concept scenario's that inhabit just enough believability (implausible as it may be) that we get some very memorable sequences in which Iris needs to communicate other than words to get help as it's out of reach only inches away. I also have to applaud cinematographer Zach Kuperstein who manages to take his largely wooded setting and keeps it looking interesting especially as it relates to POV shots from Iris making you feel her helplessness and desperation.\n\nI liked Don't Move and felt it was a nicely done thrill ride perfect for either a Halloween viewing with friends or just by yourself.

This certainly isn't an Oscar-winning masterpiece that will change your life, but just because it's not doesn't mean it's bad or mediocre, like some reviewers may have you believe.

There's a great deal of tension and suspense. The acting from the two central actors, Asbille and Wittrock, is really great. Moray Treadwell and Daniel Francis are also good. Treadwell's British accent does come and go, when he's seemingly supposed to be playing an American. Francis is convincing and good as the inquisitive, skeptical cop. The action scenes are realistic yet graphic. The film does a good job of including several close-call scenes throughout the film where Iris comes close to being rescued or escaping, only to be thwarted by Richard. That was really effective, and further elevated the unsettling ambience. This is reminiscent of another film that's somewhat similar, Alone (2020).

This character is loosely based on Cynthia Plaster Caster, an artist who gained fame for creating plaster casts of male celebrities' erect penises.",United Kingdom,English,5.4,(22K),"[{""Title"": ""What a shocking disappointment!"", ""Rating"": ""3"", ""Review Content"": ""It's not an original comment at all, but after enduring DRIVE-AWAY DOLLS, I really felt like I had been left dumber than I was going in. This movie is such a massive mis-fire, I'm really shocked it got any kind of release. What drew me in was my 40 year long affection for the films of the Coen Brothers. I figured with a film from Ethan Coen, I was in for a breezy good time like some of the Coen's lesser works offered (I'm thinking INTOLERABLE CRUELTY or maybe BURN AFTER READING). What I got was a ridiculous mash-up of themes, none of which were well thought out or entertaining.\n\nThis 84 minute movie follows Jamie (Margaret Qualley) and Marian (Geraldine Viswanathan), two friends who also happen to be lesbians (but are not \""together\""). Jamie is a wild-child from Texas, all one-night stands and hedonistic. Marian is buttoned-up and hasn't had a lover in 3 years or more. While not exactly closeted, the 1999 setting of this film means she isn't exactly openly gay either. They decide to take a trip down to Tallahassee (I don't even recall all the rationale for that), and to make it financially viable to do so, they use a drive-away service that hooks them up with a car bound for that very Florida city. Sadly, the owner of the drive-away service thought the two young ladies worked for the criminals who ARE supposed to be driving the car south, leading to a pair of \""goons\"" (as listed in the credits) to chase after the two young ladies in a time before real cell phone coverage or other tech that might have made the pursuit easier.\n\nAntics ensue, revolving mostly around the sexual shenanigans of the two girls (mostly kinda icky), the endless arguments between the two goons (none of which were interesting at all) and the eventual discovery of what was in the trunk of the car that the ladies aren't supposed to know about (involving the creation of plaster casts made of the private parts of certain conservative political figures).\n\nMy biggest problem with the film was the ridiculous, over-the-top portrayal of lesbian sexuality. Coupled with the silly plaster casts we are often obliged to gaze at, and you've got a film that feels like it was written by a ninth grade boy who doesn't understand how sex works and REALLY doesn't understand how lesbian sex works. Most of the sex scenes were embarrassing to watch, they were so childish.\n\nThese scenes MIGHT have been at least some fun, had they not starred the truly dreadful Margaret Qualley. I've seen her give decent performances before (NOVITIATE, ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD), but here her wild energy is uncontained and generic. Nothing she does feels rooted in any kind of reality, even the skewed reality of this film. It wants to be a daring performance; instead, it is silly and not for one moment did it feel like I watching a real person. Viswanathan, on the other hand, is marginally convincing, and the only character we root for at all.\n\nPedro Pascal and Matt Damon make very brief cameo appearances. They both look dreadfully embarrassed to be in the film. (I felt actively bad for Damon.) And the film even manages to make the delightful Colman Domingo uninteresting.\n\nA deep disappointment, insulting to lesbians (rather than \""liberating\"" as I assume it intended to be) and simply stunning to be coming from Ethan Coen.

As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise, it's been a long time since iv'e encountered this level of world-building and epicness. The plot and story development are carried out in an awe-inspiring manner throughout the movie, progressing at a precise pace toward a spectacular climax that is executed perfectly.\n\nDenis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time, and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high-budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does. The film received praise from many great filmmakers, the most notable being Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight Trilogy, Oppenheimer), who very accurately compared Villeneuve's achievement in this film to the \""Empire Strikes Back\"" of the modern era.\n\nWould highly recommend to re-watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better, though it's not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self-contained. More specifically, one of the most prominent and impressive strengths of the movie is how it stands on its own without relying too heavily on the first part. Of course, for those who really want to enjoy the story, there's no real point in watching the second part without having seen the first one. However, even those who watched it a few years ago and don't remember every little plot detail will be able to catch up very quickly while watching the Pt. 2 and will understand all the important details-even the smaller ones. Non-ideally, even someone who hasn't watched the first movie at all will greatly enjoy this one, as it is very self-contained despite relying heavily on the first movie-an impressive and highly commendable screenplay effort by the writers.\n\nTimothée Chalamet delivers a very impressive and charismatic performance, to the point where it seems like this is the role he was born to play. Zendaya also gives a very good performance, with significantly more screen time than in the first movie. Austin Butler manages to be terrifying in the role of the villain, Rebecca Ferguson shines in one of the best performances of the year, and Javier Bardem surprises in a role that sometimes provides the comic relief of the movie. In addition to them, the film is filled with top-tier actors and actresses who all perform their roles amazingly.\n\nHans Zimmer's score is masterful just as you'd expect, and one step up from the Oscar winning and Grammy nominated score of Pt. 1. Technical aspects such as VFX, Production Design, Sound, Editing, etc. Are all top notch and awards-worthy. The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine. Denis direction is impeccable, and the story is absolutely fascinating- continuing to develop characters from Pt. 1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters.\n\nIn my personal opinion, the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect. While the first part was excellent, it mainly served as a setup and positioning of the pieces for the sequel. In \""Part 2,\"" the story reaches its climax, with one of the strongest climaxes seen on the big screen in recent decades, befitting the complex work Frank Herbert wrote many years ago.\n\nI believe (and surely hope) this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season. Below-the-line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now, but I hope it will get some love in above-the-line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture, perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy/Sci-Fi genre in recent years at the Academy. As a big fan of the genre, unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period, maybe it's time for a movie like this to triumph once again.\n\nWhile the movie serves as a great wrap-up to the story introduced in Pt. 1, in my opinion it could serve as an even better set-up to a possible masterpiece in \""Dune: Messiah\"", which I really hope will get green-lit soon.\n\nDon't miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX, since I believe it's an historic piece of epic-Fantasy/Sci-Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre.\n\nExtremely recommended."", ""Upvotes"": ""1.1K"", ""Downvotes"": ""408"", ""Reviewer"": ""Dvir971""}, {""Title"": ""Ladies and gentleman.. the PEAK of filmmaking!!"", ""Rating"": ""10"", ""Review Content"": ""This is the kind of movie that is impossible to do justice, just by talking about it!

The first hour is a back and forth of random tests and does she like him or not. Many characters simply appear in the movie, some deep into the runtime, including a main villain who has no discernible traits other than evil for the sake of it. Some characters appear very briefly and don't do much at all. The motivation of everyone was stripped out of the script. We see an abundant amount of screen time on someone riding a worm, but large battles will abrubtly end after very little setup. Did we need a large segment of screen time involving the nukes, when we could've just been told that there's nukes? The nuke scene feels as a standout filler sequence perhaps to be overshadow a few dozen moments of filler that could've been replaced with plot.\n\nI would challenge the praisers of this film to explain why everything was perfect. Austin Butler's character was great! Why? Because he was so one dimensional? The battles are the best! You mean snippets of battles that we got and one where it was hard to tell who was who. The score was amazing! Oh, the unbelievably overused bong noise that will randomly appear in the most tepid of scenes? Even the \""twist\"" ending was foreshadowed in the first few minutes. This film is all spectacle with no emotional payoff. The number one praise that people will use to describe greatness of Dune 2 is the cinematography. This should be a leg that a great movie stands on, not the foundation. Although the direction and technicality of the look of Dune 2 is epic, the writing and editing are faulty. Maybe upon rewatches I would like it more since I might understand more of the details (after getting those details from other sources), but it's still nowhere as good as it could be or as most everyone seems to think it is."", ""Upvotes"": ""445"", ""Downvotes"": ""195"", ""Reviewer"": ""movies_are_life_""}]"

It's pure insanity. Musical about drug dealers and corruption in Mexico??? WTF???\n\n\""Emilia Perez\"" is really inventive. It blends a lot of different genres: drama, comedy, musical, thriller, but does it in a very good and entertaining way. It's also extremely original and also suprisingly emotional. There is a character in here that has a moving and heartbreaking journey throughout the movie. I'm not gonna go into details. It's not really a spoiler cause it's revealed in first 15-20 minutes into the movie but I didn't knew about it and I was shocked that this movie went into that direction. That's why advise you not to read description and to go see it fully blind if u want to have the best possible experience.\n\nThe best thing about this \""Emilia Perez\"" are definitely perfomances. It won Best Actress Award at Cannes for as many as 4 perfomances (Karla Sofia Gascon, Zoe Saldana, Selena Gomez, Adriana Paz). Saldana plays the main character and has a lot of intense and showy scenes (especially the musical ones). I'm happy that after all these blockbusters she finally got the role where she could show her acting chops. Gascon plays titular character. It's kinda supporting role but tbh she's the heart of the movie and the whole plot takes place around her. Gomez and Paz were good but I'm suprised they also won the Palme - their perfomances wasn't as great and memorable as Saldana's and Gascon's.\n\nJacques Audiard's vision is bold and impressive. This movie is stylish and looks beautiful. I love the cinematography and score. Not eveything works perfectly and there were a few moments where I wasn't fully sold out on this but most of the time, I was enjoying it and I was amazed by its craziness, ingenuity and originality. I'm not a big fan of musicals but the musical scenes (which there aren't many) in that movie are gripping and very well choreographed & shot which makes them enjoyable to watch. The songs are catchy and memorable (my favs are about vaginoplasty and the taste of Cola).\n\n\""Emilia Perez\"" is not for everyone. Some people were walking out, some were saying it's one of the worst movies of the festival, some were loving it (including me). General public is not gonna love this. The closest movie to this I've saw is \""Annette\"" by Leos Carax. \""Emilia Perez\"" is more crowd-pleasing, but it's still gonna miss with a lot of people. But I still encourage you to see it.

It's a powerhouse performance that is so of our time. I'm proud to be alive in a time when a trans actress plays a trans role. And not only that, she nails it. The tragedy of leaving a life but the promise of the one she's always needed.\n\nZoe gets to sing, dance, cry and laugh and everything which I think an actor dreams of doing, let alone in one film. I had never seen a film of hers before and I am so happy this was my first because she shines! There's a scene of her in a car, where realising what has just transpired, she breaks down in hysteria. Think Margo in I, Tonya or Glenn in Dangerous Liasons. That scene alone should win her an Academy award. And she has a beautiful voice!\n\nSelena, for whom I was most excited to see this film, kicks it out of the ballpark. Playing a mob wife, that icy, storm-simmering-below-the-surface kind of woman which she needs to revisit IMO because as a young girl who endured intense scrutiny and then went through a psychosis, she knows it too well what's it like to keep a lid on too long. The one time during the screening where I felt I was having an out of body experience is where her character Jessi finally unleashes her emotions onto us the audience after years of being oppressed. The agony and anger is heard in her voice. It's evidence of why she has said acting is her true calling and how passionate she is about it. It would be stupid to still think she's a disney kid and still has something to prove. Her acting journey is truly so exciting as a fan of almost 2 decades.\n\nLastly, Adrianas character is like the sunshine in the otherwise dark and twisted world the film lives in. She is poignant! And it perfectly complements the other 3 actresses work. She brings love and softness to the story through her work.\n\nOne major thing to note is that this film is like an opera. It reminds one of the Umbrellas of Cherbourg, which was also almost entirely sung. Emotionally it's definitely intense like one, with small moments of calm when you realise you're watching a film.\n\nThe cinematography was brilliant. At the end of the film, selenas character lays almost unconscious on the passenger seat as her lover drives in rage. The way the camera pans across the car to her face... it felt like a painting, very poetic but tragic.\n\nSo glad to have watched it before it's netflix release.

Following my somewhat underwhelming session with Pathaan, I kept a leash (albeit hesitantly) on my expectations and went in anticipating another of those messy, turbulent affairs. But to my surprise, \""Fighter\"" made a solid impression, and I have a lot to say about it, so without further ado, let me begin.\n\nStarting with...\n\nPositives:\n\nVisuals and Cinematography - The VFX in Pathaan was mostly subpar, barely passable as a competent project; therefore, many (including me) were quite vocal about it, and it seems like Mr. Anand paid heed to our criticism and made sure the mistakes didn't get repeated. Barring a handful of sequences, most of the shots look polished and neatly pieced together. Even a keen eye would have difficulties noticing the usage of green screens; that strong is the immersion, and that makes the theatre experience more prominent and inspiring.\n\nMusic and Background Score - Contrary to many, I actually like the album; each song has a different flavor to it, and they work well enough when placed in the narrative as well. The score is superior; you could literally feel the Jets fly by (the reverberations shake the seats), and it knows when to tone down and when to pitch up. Great Job!\n\nFast-Moving Screenplay - An almost three-hour duration might scare some people away, but let me assure you, it never gets tedious, all thanks to a fast-moving script that barely dips and stays resolute on its course throughout the runtime. Not once did I feel it getting dragged or unnecessarily stretched!\n\nTangibility of the Emotional Moments - Every scene that was meant to make the audience feel for the characters and for their losses or victories, they managed to do so with such elegance and authority. A big reason why they worked is because the writing sets up this elite squad of pilots (the Air Dragons) quite diligently in the initial phase. The bond and camaraderie showcased between the members helped establish their personalities as well as their backstories, which in turn compelled us to forge a personal connection with each one of them. A commendable storytelling on display.\n\nPerformances - Like I previously stated, the emotions run high and work well, but that wouldn't have been the case had the actors not played their parts with sincerity and commitment. Hrithik, Deepika, and Anil Kapoor, three leads, did fantastic jobs in their respective roles, strong and firm for the most, but don't shy away from showing their vulnerable sides when deemed necessary.\n\nNow with the...\n\nNegatives, or 'Negative' rather, as I only have one, which is:\n\nWeak Antagonist - As has been the core problem of many of Sid Anand's works (with the sole exception of Pathaan where John Abraham, as Jim was amazing), Fighter too inherits a 'villain problem.' Azhar Akhtar, the main antagonist, although played tactfully by the newcomer Rishabh Sawhney, lacks the punch and gravitas these movies usually require. He looks menacing, and his acts induce fear, but the writing on his character is lousy and begets nothing impressionable in the end.\n\nLastly...\n\nMixed:\n\nDialogues - While the general conversations, the tender junctures in particular, carry sensible and upright dialogue writing, the quality of the lines conspicuously suffers whenever and wherever the movie takes its intensity up. The writing, out of the blue enters this subpar, almost cringe category, which was, to be honest, slightly off-putting.\n\nSo yeah, that's about it. To sum up my overall view, I enjoyed the movie; you could say it succeeded my expectations and gave me the kind of entertainment I demand from such features, hence, I highly recommend this."", ""Upvotes"": ""35"", ""Downvotes"": ""50"", ""Reviewer"": ""SoumikBanerjee1996""}]"

With stunning visuals and a narrative that radiates humanity in a world devoid of humans, the movie is a testament to cinema's power to tell universal stories.\n\nThe plot follows a black cat, a solitary survivor on a post-human planet seemingly healing from humanity's scars. The feline's journey is both physical and symbolic: it must leave the safety of its island-marked by decayed monuments and submerged ruins-and embark on a voyage of collaboration and self-discovery. Watching the cat navigate this journey is a meditative and visually hypnotic experience, with Zilbalodis delivering sequences that oscillate between tranquil introspection and genuine tension.\n\nOne of the film's greatest strengths lies in its stylized animation. Unlike the hyper-realism often seen in Hollywood productions, \""Flow\"" embraces a visual style that blends natural elements with graphic artistry. The interplay of light with the textures of water, foliage, and animal fur creates an effect that is simultaneously dreamlike and visceral. This approach immerses the audience in the film's world without feeling like a forced simulation of reality. Each scene feels like a living painting, meticulously composed yet retaining a sense of spontaneous wonder.\n\nNarratively, the film adopts a simplicity reminiscent of a classic fable. The central metaphor-the need to abandon ego in favor of collectivity-is subtly woven throughout the story. As other animals join the cat on its boat, such as the sleepy capybara, the optimistic Labrador, and the restless lemur, the journey transforms into an exploration of coexistence. Each character is animated to reflect their unique traits, from the cat's sharp curiosity to the imposing bird's commanding presence. Their interactions-whether delicate gestures like sharing food or moments of conflict-form the emotional core of the story.\n\n\""Flow\"" takes a bold step by opting for a dialogue-free narrative, a choice that, for the most part, enhances the cinematic experience. While this approach may slightly soften the emotional intensity in certain scenes, it underscores the universality of the story and lets the visuals take center stage. The film's symbolism, such as the recurring image of the animals' reflections on the water, is both striking and accessible, offering straightforward interpretations while inviting deeper exploration of its layers.\n\nThe score, composed by Zilbalodis in collaboration with Rihards Zalupe, is another standout element. Minimalist and atmospheric, it perfectly complements the film's richly detailed soundscape. The sporadic use of music, rather than constant accompaniment, heightens the impact of silence, creating an immersive and meditative experience.\n\nUltimately, \""Flow\"" is a meditation on our connection to the natural world and to one another. Without words, it conveys the importance of seeing ourselves as part of something greater, accepting that our impact on the world is shaped by how we interact with it and those around us. As we face an uncertain future filled with climate crises and existential challenges, \""Flow\"" offers a hopeful message: life persists, adapting and flowing like a river carving new paths among the stones.\n\nThis is a film that demands patience and contemplation, but it generously rewards those who allow themselves to be carried by its current.

I also loved the use of shaky cinematography throughout the film, which gave the film an added sense of urgency and rawness.\n\nThe original soundtrack is mysterious and perfectly suited to the film. It weaves tension, curiosity, and surprise into key moments, making the experience even more powerful. The cat, as the central character, carries the film effortlessly. The entire plot feels surreal, with the animals driven by survival instincts. Each animal's unique personality shines: the cat is naturally skeptical, the capybara serves as a gentle caretaker, the dog embodies a loyal golden retriever, the lemur is selfish and materialistic, and the bird feels like the cat's guardian angel.\n\nThe film's core theme is fear, which is explored beautifully through visual storytelling. Even with no dialogue, there's palpable drama and tension throughout, proving that words aren't necessary to convey deep emotional weight.

The look is off everything from camerawork to editing to the costumes to vehicles to action scenes. Loads of bad CGI replaces the high octane realistic crazy stunts and motor mayhem from fury road. It all looks shot in a studio with fake everything. Big drop in quality and a sense of realism.\n\nIt's sad to see that Miller has settled for the studio instead of real vehicles in real environments with neck breaking stunts. Both clothes and vehicles just looks very designed now as well instead of a somewhat believable mishmash of what can be found in the wastelands. It's also a-lot cleaner in every way, vehicles look shiny and newly made. It just feels more censored and less naked and rough.\n\nThe story surprises nobody and is pretty much exactly what you expect. Void from a lot of the epic action scenes you might have to expect after fury road. You get some decent action but Fury Road is the gold standard here and this is not even close. Look and feels more like a cookie cutter action movie set in the Mad Max universe. Had I have to guess without knowing it I would never have guessed that Miller directed this.

While action sequences are, as expected, top notch, the epic sense of awe and sheer crazy excitement that ludicrous stunts and choreography brought us in Fury Road was lacking. Editing was sometimes atrocious. Even in the best action or \""poignant\"" scenes this movie had to offer, I never felt that I'm watching it from the edge of my seat, nor did I get emotionally involved with any of characters.\n\nSpeaking of which, acting was fairly wooden, lines declamatory delivered, the script overall seemed recycled and overly done, bordering on boring. Storytelling was chaotic, rushed and dragged at the same time. Sometimes the unnecessary narrator helped things to move along, unfortunately in a bad way.\n\nBut the major flaw was that there was no hero's journey for any of characters. Furiosa is the same person at the beginning as she is at the end of a movie, same as Dementus. Remember Nux and his journey? There is nothing like it in Furiosa. Furthermore, Furiosa endures every hardship with the same fierce look in her eyes - we never see pain, never fear, never doubt. She shrugs any injury off, like a terminator. It was hard to get emotionally involved with her character. Unfortunately, she came across as a classic girl boss, amazing in everything she does from the start to the finish, as a kid, and as an adult.

Big big shoes to fill, I completely love Fury Road - a perfect action film in every way, so I was prepared to have this film fall in its shadow. Which it did. Furiosa is fun but its sadly no FR.\n\nThe good news: You want action? There is action, loads of it. Like any good Mad Max story it holds true to its promise to entertain the masses with spectacle. Glorious. We get the hot rods, big wheels, diggers, bikes of all shapes and sizes, as well as flying contraptions, weaponry galore and no holding back on the violence. Explosions, bodies flying, witness me etc. Plenty. It can be brutal and nasty but true to form and true to Mad Max. What more do you want?\n\nCasting is good, perhaps a few too many characters leaving each of them to have not quite enough to do especially with Immortan Joe's followers. Anja Taylor Joy is good as Furiosa and Hemsworth seems to really be enjoying himself. Dementus is a great villain, a sort of love child of Immortan Joe and The Humungus; the presence, the wee speeches, his villainy is fun. And he gets to be very Aussie no need to hide that accent. I also liked a younger and much cleverer Immortan Joe; in this film he's not the core bad guy and without the need to get his 5 wives back as a motivator making him crazy we get to see him as the warlord he is. Smart and patient and in control.\n\nAnd there's world building! Which was very cool. We got to see more of the Wasteland and get hints of how it ticks and what made it so.\n\nThe bad news: Visually Furiosa is a bit of a mixed bag; sometimes we get stuff worthy of its predecessor and other times we get stuff that is... less so. The colour is much more pale than the richness of FR and the cinematography is no where near the standards. Occasionally the CGI lets the film down just a bit. In Fury Road you got the impression that it was almost all practical effects even if it wasn't. In Furiosa there are sequences where I went... 'eww, yikes' as the standards of the film dropped. Only a few moments but be prepared.\n\nThe music is often absent or very lacking. The sweeping epics of Fury Road are almost gone instead we get much more background stuff or even sadly largely silent action sequences. This leads to a lack of tension, nothing edge of your seat here.\n\nThe writing and edit isn't great. The characters lack spark and bits feel missing. Miller is trying to tell a story but seems unsure of how to write characters in which one can invest. Furiosa has more ambition in its story telling and I think its execution is lacking. The core story solid but it seems a bit empty on the screen. The film jumps at times skipping over character development worthy of exploration.\n\nIn the edit i really really missed the fast cuts of Fury where Miller really built his scenes through tight production and cuts and edits where everything builds beautifully and leads to a great conclusions. Miller did this scene after scene in FR whereas in Furiosa its really lacking. Means theres not as much tension, not as many 'that was close' nor 'that was amazing' moments.\n\nOverall I did like it. Furiosa is a good Mad Max film but its no Fury Road. I'd be surprised if the film is recognized at Oscar time, where Fury Road won 6 Furiosa might get a nomination or two in the technical but no nominations for Directing or Best Picture.\n\nBy my deeds I honour him...\n\nBy my wallet I honour George Miller, Witness Furiosa.

Maggots, amputation, and body horror that feels like a bait and switch from what we were promised. That brings us to the worst component and why the movie fails, comparable to why the fourth Matrix failed. The casting. Anya just cant carry a film like this no matter how much gritty makeup they cover her in. Any time she talks all tough you want to just cringe. They knew this so gave her as few lines as possible and just made her look cool. But you can't hang a film on an actor with such little charisma. And what on earth is Chris Hemsworth doing in this movie? He is badly miscast and half the time you wonder how he's supposed to be the villain when he's so light hearted and likeable. This kills the core of the revenge story. You should be hating him more than she does. The other guy, the guy she teams up with should have been the villain--he looks and acts ice cold--and Hemsworth should have taken his role.

High Grant gives by far his best ever performance, riffing on the easy going charm of his romantic screen persona until something far more sinister is revealed. The two Mormon characters though are very poorly written and behave both stupidly and inconsistently to how they have been established which makes the whole thing a lot less engaging.

Grant's portrayal, layered with a quiet intensity, draws us into the mystery of Reed's character, skillfully weaving charm and menace. The dialogue is elegantly crafted, with a razor-sharp wit that is self-aware and relatable enough that you can imagine a similar dialogue (and maybe just as scary) happening after thanksgiving dinner between a few salty relatives. It's the kind of banter that delights as much as it disturbs, showing that screenwriters knew how to dance with words and really capitalize on Grant's electric everyman charm.\n\nBut, for me, they fumbled the choreography of the plot itself.\n\nThe atmosphere in Heretic is ripe with tension, a steadily simmering suspense that feels almost Hitchcockian (I'm being generous, but it's good). Yet, unlike Hitchcock's masterpieces, where each action feels inevitable, Reed's journey teeters precariously on the edge of believability, but never really lands there for me. While we're willing to suspend disbelief for a while, waiting to hear Reed's motivator, the film's premise ultimately strains under the weight of its own ambitions. Mr. Reed's improbable decisions-and the film's insistence that these are plausible-leave one questioning not only his motives but perhaps even the script's own coherence. It's as though the filmmakers were intent on building a labyrinth but forgot to place a satisfying prize at its center. Sure, the payoff leads to Reed's main point, philosophically, but his actions in the end seem so bizarre and unjustified by the plot that I was scratching my head trying to figure out why he didn't just start a skeptics YouTube channel and be done with it.\n\nIn the end, we're left with a hollow aftertaste, a sense of having been led to a precipice only to find the bridge unbuilt. While Grant's performance deserves commendation, even his talent can't fully bridge the gap between the film's fascinating setup and its underwhelming resolution.\n\nAnd, without spoilers, the mild final nod to the OTHER possibility was a weak plot move that feels like throwing a bone to the losing philosophical side on the off chance you offended someone.\n\nIn sum, Heretic is a beautiful journey through the maze with Grant manhandling the role from start to finish, even if it leaves you feeling somewhat lost upon reaching its incomplete end.\n\nIf only the filmmakers had paid as much attention to plot structure as they did to Reed's impeccable, if confounding, choices, Heretic might have stood among this year's most memorable thrillers.\n\nWhatever I think of THIS movie, I can't wait to see more Hugh Grant in the horror genre. That was a true joy. Also, honorable mention to the two leading ladies who played well off of each other.

On the surface, it's one of the most locked-in mid-90's nostalgia pieces I've ingested, but beneath that it's one of the most complex coming-of-age films I can think of.\n\nTo me, the movie was an expression of the kids who grew up in dysfunctional families in the 90's (the TV generation), those who were drawn to dark media due to that (which was extremely prevalent in the late 80's up through the mid 90's), and in turn, those who ended up with a far deeper connection with those dark fantasy worlds than they had with most other humans, and reality as a whole. When it's time to grow up, things get rough...I can relate, because I was 100% one of those kids during that exact era, so this one hit a lot of buttons that made a lot of sense for me.\n\nThere are some impressively unique horror/monster effects in this film, that are equal parts comical and terrifying, simultaneously, which feels like yet another element that is heavily loyal to the era it is inspired by. This, along with many other elements, allow this movie to differentiate itself pretty boldly from everything else coming out right now. Common horror fans will likely just be confused by this film, which tends to be the case with most psychological horror films that actually offer anything with emotional purpose, but it offers plenty of cerebral scares and lots of melancholic gloom.\n\nLeads Brigette Lundy-Paine and Justice Smith do an immense job of keeping things deathly serious and dreamlike, Smith almost feeling like he fittingly \""can't handle being human\"" a lot of the time. There are several sequences where their performances bring the movie to a full Lynchian realm - of course this is also due to visionary director Jane Schoenbrun's skilled directing. Speaking of that, I just realized that the segment that feels most like a nod to Lynch in a multitude of ways is the one that features bands performing live at a strange club, much like the Road House in the last season of Twin Peaks. Kris Esfandiari of King Woman makes an especially strong appearance here. It certainly doesn't hurt that they put together a very tasteful soundtrack that feels very reminiscent of the classic movie soundtracks of the 90's. It's fitting that the movie and soundtrack begin with a Broken Social Scene cover, because the whole album kind of feels like a full Broken Social Scene album, with similar dynamics and vibes throughout.\n\nWhile it's truly hard to compare this to anything, it feels HIGHLY inspired by ARE YOU AFRAID OF THE DARK?, the Canadian kids horror program broadcast in the 90's on Nickelodeon, more than anything, while it's themes remind me only of a couple other movies, Pixar's INSIDE OUT, and the very wild SYNECDOCHE, NEW YORK. While I cried my eyes out at that Pixar movie, this one is too committed to its surrealism and gloom to induce actual tears, but the overall melancholy remains very heavy and very real throughout.\n\nThis is a movie about the weirdos who found solace in media for weirdos. Brilliantly, the movie itself is weird (and sincere) enough to be that exact sort of weird type of media that the new young weirdos may find the same kind of solace in when they watch this as a teenager in reality now.

The movie does center on a TV show for young people, but the type of show it is and its role in the characters' lives are much different.

Writer-director Jane Schoenbrun's incomprehensible smart horror offering is an absolute utter waste of time, not to mention the ticket price. This story of two psychologically and emotionally troubled teens, Owen (Ian Forema) and Maddy (Brigitte Lundy-Paine), who bond over a cheesy late night 1990s young adult sci-fi/horror television series called The Pink Opaque struggles mightily to find its way. As Owen grows into an adult (Justice Smith), his cohort vanishes mysteriously when the TV series is abruptly cancelled, leaving him wondering what happened to her until she just as mysteriously reappears years later with a disjointed story that makes no sense from top to bottom. As the film's narrator, Owen tries earnestly to explain, but his recounting of this experience is equally baffling, especially when he tells why Maddy has come back after her protracted absence. The result is an unintelligible tale that's far from frightening (even metaphorically speaking) and ends up being a convoluted mix of 1990s teen angst, extended and inexplicably incorporated music videos, an exploration of sexual ambiguity, and a woefully wayward attempt at symbolically addressing issues related to personal disassociation and self-actualization. There are also numerous story elements and images that are included in the narrative that go undeveloped and unexplored. To its credit, the picture features a fine production design, intriguing cinematography, a good measure of campy comic relief (though not nearly enough of it) and a skillfully assembled soundtrack (handily this release's best attribute). However, when a film's musical guests receive greater billing than its cast members and the soundtrack ends up being its strongest asset, that doesn't speak well about the production's overall quality. To be honest, I get genuinely annoyed (and feel egregiously ripped off) when I leave the theater having screened a picture whose trailer and marketing seem to offer so much promise and end up failing miserably when it comes to delivering the goods, and that's very much the case with this pretentious, sophomoric cinematic train wreck.

Walter Salles, with his raw style and unmatched sensitivity, returns to the theme of a country immersed in repression, but rather than focusing on big political events, he zeroes in on their consequences within homes and personal lives. By centering the story on family drama, Salles subverts the expectation of a traditional historical film, avoiding documentary tones or a broad, structural focus. Here, 1970s Brazil is felt through the struggles of the Paiva family, and in the painful details of their shared wounds, Salles portrays the scars left by a dictatorship that, while distorted in collective memory, remains alive in the lives it shattered.\n\nChoosing to center the narrative through Eunice's perspective-played by the iconic Fernanda Torres and Fernanda Montenegro-lends the film an undeniable authenticity. While dealing with the loss of her husband, Rubens Paiva (Selton Mello), a public figure and defender of the people's rights, Eunice has to keep the family together and maintain her children's emotional stability. Eunice is the pure embodiment of resilience and motherly love, and her daily routine, her rituals with her children, and moments shared as a family are slices of a once-ordinary life, now wrecked by an abrupt absence. Family dinners and memories of beach outings become painful when revisited after Rubens' disappearance, as they reveal the empty space left by systemic violence. Salles skillfully uses this family intimacy to show how dictatorship destroys emotional bonds and disrupts each home's peace, prompting audiences to reflect on how history is also shaped by losses and silent moments in everyday life.\n\nFernanda Torres' performance is intensely deserving of praise. She embodies a woman who refuses to let grief immobilize her, balancing the protection of her children with the relentless search for answers about her husband's whereabouts. This balance between strength and vulnerability gives Eunice a striking and essential presence in the film. In a moving and remarkably mature performance, Montenegro, as the older Eunice, intensifies the impact of Rubens' absence, bringing a heavy, almost physical silence that resonates in those who never got the chance to say goodbye. The real-life relationship between Montenegro and Torres as mother and daughter adds authenticity to the transitions across time, making Eunice's portrayal even more heartfelt and believable. This genuine continuity allows Salles' film to transcend mere fiction and reach a depth that only a personal story can achieve.\n\nTechnically, the film is a visual achievement that captures this family's intimate pain through meticulously crafted cinematography. The use of confined spaces and close-up shots reveals the characters' physical and psychological confinement, mirroring the oppression that hangs over their lives. The soundtrack follows the most emotional scenes with an almost mystical quality, blending with the characters' feelings like a whisper that holds the pains of the past. Salles' use of music is interesting, not just to intensify the drama but to evoke an almost tangible nostalgia in the air, an echo of absences that can never be overcome. This balance between aesthetics and emotion transforms the film into both a tribute to interrupted lives and a celebration of the struggle for justice and memory.\n\nThe narrative avoids an easy or simplistic conclusion, choosing instead a more contemplative view on the lasting impact of loss. The film moves forward in time, showing us the future of each family member without offering conclusive or comforting answers. What remains is the pain, an indignation turned into strength, and a refusal to let difficult moments fade into oblivion. Rubens' absence and the commitment of Eunice and her children to preserving his memory result in a catharsis for the audience, as it's both inspiring and deeply moving to see how they, even amid so much pain, resist the urge to let Rubens' legacy be erased-and the film's goal to evoke tears was masterfully achieved, at least for me.\n\nOverall, \""I'm Still Here\"" is one of those rare historical films that, instead of adopting a documentary or openly critical stance, takes a humanistic approach that resonates with our deepest emotions and values. Salles proves his mastery as a filmmaker by crafting a story that is, at once, infuriating and inspiring-a work that reminds us of the importance of keeping the memories and voices of the wronged alive. Through a captivating narrative and an extraordinary cast, he turns the story of a Brazilian family into a universal reminder of human dignity and the importance of memory as a form of resistance."", ""Upvotes"": ""126"", ""Downvotes"": ""21"", ""Reviewer"": ""heyflp""}, {""Title"": ""An essencial work, balancing emotion and reflection"", ""Rating"": ""9"", ""Review Content"": ""Brazilian film with the greatest international repercussion in recent years, winner of the best screenplay award at the Venice Film Festival and nominated for an Oscar, I'm Still Here dramatizes the trajectory of the Paiva family between the arrest of Rubens Paiva, the father, and Eunice's struggle after her husband's disappearance.

While the premise is deliciously creepy, the execution lands somewhere between a campy throwback and a missed opportunity for deeper thematic exploration.\n\nThere's no denying the film's fun factor. The first act lures you in with idyllic Italian countryside visuals and a warm welcome for Cecilia. But the cracks soon begin to show, and the movie gleefully dives into increasingly bizarre and bloody territory. Think The Wicker Man meets Suspiria with a dash of Sweeney's signature intensity. The special effects, while not top-of-the-line, lean into a practical, grotesque quality that complements the film's grindhouse vibe.\n\nSweeney is the undeniable star here. She beautifully portrays Cecilia's transformation from wide-eyed innocent to a woman fighting for survival, both physically and emotionally. There's a vulnerability in her performance that makes you root for her, even as she descends into badassery. The supporting cast, however, feels a bit one-note. Their portrayals of the enigmatic nuns are more stereotypical than chilling.\n\nThe historical and cultural context of Catholicism is undeniably present, with religious iconography and rituals fueling the film's atmosphere. However, Immaculate doesn't quite commit to a deeper social commentary on faith or female subjugation. It throws out intriguing themes but doesn't fully explore them, leaving me wanting more.\n\nThe score is a haunting blend of choral music and discordant strings, perfectly capturing the unsettling duality of the convent. The editing is sharp, keeping the pace brisk and the scares coming. There's a sense of stylish chaos to the film, particularly in the later acts, that's undeniably entertaining.\n\nImmaculate isn't immaculate. The script could have benefited from tighter plotting and a clearer thematic focus. But for fans of campy horror with a strong leading performance, it delivers a wild ride. So, if you're looking for something to shock you and maybe make you laugh a little (nervously), then step into the convent with Cecilia.

Produced by and starring blossoming Hollywood star Sydney Sweeney, the film had been a passion project of hers after auditioning for the role in 2014. Though it fell through at the time, Sweeney recently acquired the project and became the film's producer. After revising the script, she chose Michael Mohan as the director due to their experience working together on previous projects such as The Voyeurs and Everything Sucks. Partnering with independent film distributor NEON, Immaculate quickly came to an exciting fruition.\n\nAfter a near death experience in her childhood, Cecilia (Sydney Sweeney) vows to devote herself to the lord as she begins her new life as a nun. The only American in an Italian convent, Cecilia finds herself as an outsider from most of her peers. Suffering a nightmarish encounter, she unexpectedly learns that she is pregnant with an immaculate conception. As her pregnancy progresses and the convent begin worshipping her, she becomes overwhelmed by the feeling of uncertainty. Digging deeper, unsettling discoveries lead Cecilia to question her unlikely situation and fear for what may come next.\n\nImmaculate brings a refreshing style to the modern horror genre. Steadily burning and becoming increasingly uncomfortable, the film creates an unsteady aura that lands viewers on the edge of their seats. Set and filmed in the Italian countryside, the hyper-religious focus makes for an eerie environment when mysterious encounters begin. Though there are a few moments which go a bit over the top, the outlandish nature of the entire situation allows those aspects to fit decently into the pilgrimage. Coming in at 1 ½ hours, the short runtime races by as every moment is packed with continually captivating developments that keep viewers immersed in the roller coaster of events. The haunting journey culminates in a heart-pounding final act, which does not subside until the credits begin roll.\n\nTaking on the lead role alongside her first time producing, Sydney Sweeney is remarkably captivating as she traverses through her uncharted territory. She is chillingly convincing in her role and seamlessly switches from charming to traumatized with exceptional facial emoting. After being one of the best parts in the disastrous Madame Web, Sweeney is certainly expunged of that sin with this devout performance. Immaculate is one of Sweeney's most memorable and well-executed roles, hopefully paving the way for her to continue producing projects that she is passionate about.\n\nImmaculate succeeds in crafting a surreal psychological experience. Sydney Sweeney produces an intriguing story and elevates the journey further with her truly harrowing performance. Horror buffs and casual fans alike will rejoice as the genre is gifted a film which should undoubtably be discussed alongside similar distinguished thrillers such as Eraserhead or Mother. Passionately conceived, Immaculate is a hopeful beacon for original ideas in Hollywood and leaves the future bright for the next step in Sweeney's prosperous career."", ""Upvotes"": ""49"", ""Downvotes"": ""35"", ""Reviewer"": ""Ltufano23""}, {""Title"": ""Zzzzz"", ""Rating"": ""3"", ""Review Content"": ""Not a good horror film.

The practical effects are a standout, with each kill executed with a level of gore and creativity that pushes the boundaries of the genre.

It is not insultingly bad or anything, after all, I'm giving it an above average rating.\n\nThis movie compared to the first doesn't have the soul and emotional connection you'd expect. This movie in my opinion is just another unnecessary sequel solely made for grabbing cash, and cash grab it did.\n\nThe first problem with the movie is the pacing. The story is incredibly rushed even though it has the same runtime as the first, so it's weird how everything feels like needed more time to develop, while everything in the first felt adequate and enough. The addition of the new characters definitely needed a lot more time.\n\nAt the same time, nothing that interesting happened here in my opinion, and made the whole thing boring for me. The sense of exploration of different parts of Riley's mind from the first movie is gone and the film is more focused on the real-life story, so the whole Joy and the gang going through the mind is just that, a simple road trip story. Nothing interesting or of note happens there. I don't remember a single scene in this movie that stood out to me as interesting or creative at all, while I still remember Bing Bong, them going through that train station or room that changed their animation style, the scene of them messing with Riley's dreams and many more.\n\nJust so much happened in the first film that it feels like that movie was over 2 hours. But I just did not find a single scene in this movie note-worthy.\n\nThe next problem for me is that I just don't care about these characters here, especially the new ones. There is no emotional connection, unlike the first movie. The real-life struggles of Riley in the first film were more relatable and the whole Joy realizing Sandness is necessary and the Bing Bong storyline were the soul of that film and made you actually care and have an emotional connection to them. This is nonexistent in this sequel.\n\nIt doesn't feel like they had an idea for a story and decided to make a movie about it, it feels more like a studio-mandated sequel that they tried to come up with a story afterward. The plot of this movie is so boring and so few things happen here that it feels like I'm watching Inside Out: The Series and just watching a random episode where Riley needs to get on the cool hockey team.\n\nI understand that someone would like this, especially the younger generation, but what I don't get are the 9s and 10s, because this is so obviously and clearly inferior to the first film in many aspects that I don't understand how someone can say this is on the same level or even better than the first!\n\nOverall, the movie is not that bad if you don't have anything better to watch, but I am disappointed that this movie did nothing for me after going in having seen the high ratings and the reviews. It is an example of an unnecessary cash-grab sequel. Inside Out is one I consider one of Pixar's greats and will rewatch it if I feel like it because it's a really enjoyable, deep, emotional, innovative, creative, and beautiful film. Very rewatchable. But Inside Out 2? I don't think I'll ever rewatch this one, one time was more than enough."", ""Upvotes"": ""115"", ""Downvotes"": ""46"", ""Reviewer"": ""MamadNobari97""}]"

A woman who has managed to overcome a traumatic childhood and is now chasing her dreams in Boston, including opening her own business. Her life takes a dramatic turn when she meets Ryle Kincaid, a charming neurosurgeon. Their intense connection quickly blossoms into a passionate relationship. However, as Lily delves deeper into her relationship with Ryle, she begins to see troubling similarities to her parents' tumultuous relationship. The plot thickens when Lily's first love, Atlas Corrigan, reenters her life, forcing her to make challenging decisions about her future and her own strength.\n\nAs a film reviewer who has not read the source material due to a personal vendetta against the author, I took it upon myself to evaluate the film on its own merits. So, if you're expecting a comparison to the book, you won't find that here. This review is purely based on the film itself and my personal impressions. Any remarks saying \""the book is better\"" won't resonate with me.\n\nThe film has three standout aspects: Blake Lively's performance, the soundtrack, and the cinematography. Firstly, Blake Lively's portrayal of Lily Bloom is commendable. She brings a sense of authenticity and depth to the character that is both endearing and convincing. Lively manages to capture the nuances of a woman who has endured trauma and abuse without resorting to melodrama. Her subtle expressions and mannerisms effectively convey Lily's complex emotional landscape, making her performance the film's strongest suit. Without resorting to melodrama, Lively's portrayal feels both raw and genuine, which is crucial for a character with such a disturbing background.\n\nSecondly, the soundtrack is a significant highlight. Featuring songs by Lana Del Rey and Ethel Cain, the music adds a layer of emotional depth to the narrative. The soundtrack is so compelling that it occasionally overshadows the dialogue, but this is a forgivable flaw. In many instances, the music is more engaging than the actual conversations between characters, it kinda sucks but it enhances the overall experience for audiences like me who enjoy pop music.\n\nLastly, Justin Baldoni's direction and use of handheld camerawork add a raw, realistic edge to the film. The naturalistic lighting and intimate camera angles make the film feel more grounded and relatable, which is crucial for a story that deals with heavy themes like trauma and abuse.\n\nDespite these strengths, the film has several notable weaknesses that detract from its overall impact. The narrative devices used in the film are glaringly obvious, and the dialogues often come across as pretentious. This pretentiousness, at times, borders on the ridiculous, making it difficult to take the characters seriously. While the film aims to address important issues such as trauma and generational curses, the execution is far from seamless. The blend of these themes feels forced, and the film struggles to do justice to the weighty subject matter of the source material.\n\nOne of the most evident issues is the film's runtime. At two hours, the film feels unnecessarily long and repetitive. The pacing is inconsistent, with a drawn-out opening sequence that takes up the first ten minutes, followed by a rushed progression through key points in Lily and Ryle's relationship. This hurried pace leaves little room for character development, making it hard for the audience to fully grasp Lily's trauma or the depth of her connection with Ryle. The lack of chemistry between the two leads further undermines the film's romantic subplot. The characterization is another weak point. The film barely allows the audience to process Lily's traumatic past before plunging her into a whirlwind romance with Ryle. This rushed approach makes their \""deep\"" love for each other seem superficial and unconvincing. The reintroduction of Atlas Corrigan into Lily's life, while intended to create conflict, feels more like a plot device than a meaningful part of the story. After all, the film does revolve around the story of Lily, so it's understandable that all characters, aside from Lily, are just background characters with little to no impact on the film. The film could have benefited from being 30 minutes shorter. With its 2-hour runtime, it felt overly long and repetitive, often going in circles without adding much to the story.\n\nIn conclusion, \""It Ends With Us\"" is a film that falls short of its potential. While it has its redeeming qualities-primarily Blake Lively's performance, the soundtrack, and cinematography-it is ultimately a forgettable and predictable story. The film's length and pacing issues, combined with its pretentious dialogues and lack of character development, make it a shallow and, at times, boring experience. For those who have not read the book and are looking for a film that tackles heavy themes with emotional depth, \""It Ends With Us\"" may still offer some emotional resonance. It has the potential to pull at the heartstrings and take the audience on an emotional rollercoaster. However, for viewers seeking substance and a more nuanced portrayal of trauma and relationships, the film is likely to disappoint.\n\n\""It Ends With Us\"" can be seen as part of the \""once beloved book turned into a film disaster\"" club. It serves as a reminder that not all popular novels translate well to the big screen. While the film does honor the heaviness and relevance of the theme to some extent, it ultimately lacks the depth and coherence needed to make it a truly memorable cinematic experience."", ""Upvotes"": ""133"", ""Downvotes"": ""54"", ""Reviewer"": ""jaysonpajaronvistal""}, {""Title"": ""Gouging my eyes out (or: horrible)"", ""Rating"": ""1"", ""Review Content"": ""I've watched a lot of movies before, and I have definitely written a review only like a few minutes before, but I felt as if I kind of went off the rails, and wanted to review just a little more.

Like David Lynch, he has developed a singular, instantly identifiable style, which will, no doubt, one day be- if it is not already- referred to as Lanthimosian. Generally speaking, his films, though varied, usually explore power dynamics, featuring characters who speak in monotone, dialogue that is slightly unreal and darkly-comic narratives containing both bloodshed and nudity.\n\n'Kinds of Kindness' bears all the hallmarks of his style. An anthology film- or triptych, as it is billed- its thematic content is open to numerous interpretations; the most obvious being control, as, in each of the three stories, it is examined in some form. In the first, a man tries to stand up to his domineering boss, with disastrous results. In the second, a policeman who is losing control of his life after the disappearance of his wife, finds things stranger upon her return. In the third and last, a woman working for a cult tries to find an individual who possesses a mysterious power.\n\nWith each tale, the case can be made that Lanthimos is examining a different aspect of control with regard to power dynamics and family structures. In the opening segment, Lanthimos explores the theme of subjugation and rebellion, highlighting the delicate balance between asserting oneself and the risks involved in challenging authority. Furthermore, the protagonist's journey can be seen as a poignant exploration of agency and longing.\n\nIn the second story the interconnecting notions of power, manipulation and the illusion of control are explored, as the policeman desperately tries to control and restructure a situation he does not recognise, nor has power over. The irrational demands he makes of his wife reveal the lengths one can go to maintain control and stability in the face of perceived chaos.\n\nThe third story raises questions about the limits of human agency, following a woman who has voluntarily given up control of her life to a cult. Like the first story, this can be seen as an exploration of subjugation and rebellion, or perhaps Lanthimos is examining fears associated with autonomy, of agency and desire.\n\nHowever, while control appears thematically in each of the stories, there could be more at play. One could, perhaps, see the film as a religious allegory, with the three stories mirroring the ideas of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Lanthimos may be inviting viewers to explore fears associated with autonomy and desire through this lens.\n\nOn the other hand, considering the sacrifice of autonomy for comfort or survival becomes a recurring motif; might the film be primarily about just that: sacrifice? Or is it merely concerned with how manipulation, dominance and submission intersect? The film's digressive structure allows ideas such as these to unfold without arriving at tidy conclusions, leaving room for as many abstractions and interpretations as there are viewers.\n\nWhatever the case, the stories are entertaining and darkly funny, full of the deliciously weird Lanthimosian dialogue many have come to love. However, as each are so engaging, it is a pity that they are not three individual, full-length films in their own right. Lanthimos and co-writer Efthimis Filippou could have expanded any of them into a stand-alone feature and, by doing so, heightened their power and impact considerably.\n\nDespite this, 'Kinds of Kindness' remains engaging and thought-provoking, boasting assured, grounded visuals that heighten the narrative's strangeness. Lanthimos and director of photography Robbie Ryan film proceedings with realism in mind, avoiding flashy stylisations and unconventional camera angles. This juxtaposition between the natural cinematography and the inherent oddness of the narrative is both atmospheric and effective.\n\nFurthermore, Jerskin Fendrix's score contributes greatly to the film's atmosphere. Full of sinister choral chants, like the singing of a group of mad monks, it adds an element of suspense and drama, complementing the visuals and the narrative. In addition, Anthony Gasparro's production design, as well as Amy Beth Silver's minimalistic set decoration and Jennifer Johnson's muted costume design, are immersive, drawing viewers further in to Lanthimos's odd world, emphasising the uncanny.\n\nThe film features some of Lanthimos's frequent collaborators, such as Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, Yorgos Stefanakos and Margaret Qualley, alongside newcomers to his oeuvre, like Jesse Plemons and Hong Chau. All play multiple characters across the three stories- bar Stefanakos- and excel in each. Plemons showcases his versatility, bringing a decency and humanity to even the cruellest of men. Stone, meanwhile, proves yet again that she is a perfect fit for Lanthimos's material, inhabiting her disparate, bizarre roles with a remarkable ease and naturality.\n\nIn addition, Dafoe demonstrates once more why many consider him one of the finest actors working today, bringing authenticity to three markedly different personalities; from the good and the bad to the ugly. Furthermore, Qualley and Chau both bring life to smaller roles, showcasing their considerable abilities, while Stefanakos- totally mute- has a strong screen presence, making his enigmatic character all the more intriguing.\n\nDarkly funny and overwhelmingly odd, 'Kinds of Kindness' is a typically Lanthimosian venture. Featuring three entertaining tales of madness, control and manipulation, it is utterly unique. Boasting striking cinematography, as well as a stirring, sinister score, one won't easily forget it.

The previous trilogy is excellent, and I'd even say it's one of the best genre trilogies ever made (LOTR is #1, of course). Dawn is especially a masterpiece of intelligent sci-fi adventure spectacle, a movie that is both exciting and intelligent. The entire trilogy is emotionally engaging and Caesar is an incredible lead.\n\nUnfortunately, this film doesn't have any characters as good as Caesar. In fact, it feels like a lesser retread of the same ideas and themes of the previous trilogy. There's nothing really new here. You've already seen a better version of this movie before.\n\nWith that said, let me get the good out of the way first. The cinematography is excellent. The visual effects are still incredible, both as a technical and artistic achievement. The first 45 minutes of the film are really solid. There's a lot of good visual storytelling in the opening act.\n\nHowever, once we meet the main antagonist, things kinda fall apart. The pacing is off. Some scenes drag, while major character moments feel rushed. There's a friction between two major characters that doesn't feel earned, especially since the characters kinda come to an understanding, and then a few scenes later they are butting heads. What could and should have been an interesting dynamic feels incomplete, like entire scenes were cut out.\n\nThe main antagonist could have been really cool. The idea of a cult-like warlord obsessed with human history, there's so much they could have done with that idea. But he simply doesn't have enough scenes to really make him anything more than Koba Part II. And Koba had better motivations and more complexity. None of the characters here are as well written as the previous trilogy and the last 10 minutes feel more like a TV finale than a movie.\n\nOh, and the music score is pretty generic and forgettable. Really disappointing, because I love the music from the other movies. Caesar's theme is so good. Nothing here comes close.\n\nAnyway...

There are reognisable influences from the 1970s TV show and even some of the Apes comic book stories of that era. But, it is also unmistakably a post-Lord of the Rings epic, the influence showing up in how various action and travel sequences have been shot.\n\nWhile there is not nearly so much sly humour as the originals, the socio-historic themes are more nuanced, closer to the surface and harder to miss. Questions of defining civilisation in terms of laws are answered in a way that will ultimately resonate with modern audiences; a layered and varied spectrum of responses to enslavement is shown; and as expected, anti-monarchist revolutions will always play well in the USA.\n\nNon-Americans may roll their eyes a little at the very earnest equating of eagles with capital-L Liberty (one can't imagine Charlton Heston's sardonic and cynical George Taylor from the 1968 movie being very impressed), but on the plus side, Peter Macon's wonderful Raka just about matches the delightful charm of Kim Hunter's Zira and Roddy McDowell's Cornelius from the originals. Owen Teague also does a good job as Noa.\n\nThe various fight scenes are competent without being overly thrilling (the most exciting action is a cornfield chase vaguely inspired by the original 1968 film), but the deeper probing into the various sub-texts and a fine selection of minor characters keeps the interest levels up. One could pick nits about some of the physics shown in the last twenty minutes, but it's hardly the first Hollywood film to sacrifice strict logic for spectacle and it surely won't be the last.\n\nOverall, this does a good job of working on several levels and should appeal to a good range of audiences."", ""Upvotes"": ""175"", ""Downvotes"": ""100"", ""Reviewer"": ""deason""}, {""Title"": ""*yawn* BOOOORRRIIINNGGG"", ""Rating"": ""Not Found"", ""Review Content"": ""The only good things I can say about this film is the CGI and the 5 min climax.

Somehow, he still gives some heart to his performance to bring out the deeper levels of Po's character development.\n\n-Awkwafina is a newcomer to the game and brings that sass and attitude to the fox character, Zhen. A great personification of the actress, she's a welcome addition to the world, with her humor fitting well into the animal antics.\n\n-And Davis rounds out the acting with a solid performance. The chameleon has a poignant prose, and her status is well-matched to Davis' strong demeanor, deep, icy voice, and threatening attitude that the actress carries well.\n\nFunny At Many Parts -If you are a fan of Kung Fu Panda humor, chances are you will find enjoyment in the fourth installment.\n\n-Po's adventure is loaded with quirky dialog that is innocent and jovial. His naivety is charming to watch, but I like how Po engages with the cavalcade of characters who spice up the antics.\n\n-His dads come along for the ride as well, forming a fun substory that held its charm and cuteness. The little intermissions from the story helped keep the humor fresh and blended nicely to the ending without going too far out of the way to accomplish it.\n\n-Altogether, the movie accomplished much in this department and stuck to its roots for simplistic chuckles and laughs.\n\nDeep Story Components -Despite being a kid's film, Kung Fu Panda 4 still manages to give some deeper plot elements that were very relevant to me.\n\n-Po's journey keeps evolving with each film, requiring the clumsy oaf to face the changes life throws at him and take the lessons to heart.\n\n-It did not matter with whom he engaged. Po somehow manages to find those vulnerabilities and engage them in a manner that feels legitimate and authentic.\n\n-This helps reign in the movie from becoming too comedic and helps viewers invest a bit more into the film and complete this journey with the panda.\n\nEntertaining End Credits -The first half of the credits gives you more animated goodness with our characters and brings some nostalgia that I quite enjoyed.\n\n-A cover by the lead actor's band accompanies the scenes and provides a solid track that matches the theme of the sequence.\n\n-Surprisingly, the song is also quite a good cover with comedy and rock beautifully combining into an engaging and energetic track.\n\nCute And Balanced -The movie accomplishes much in being an entertaining film for all ages to enjoy.\n\n-One level is the heavy emphasis on silly antics, laughable clumsiness, and the censorship that cushions the violet components of the movie.\n\n-Yet, Kung Fu Panda 4 is not pulling punches either. The movie provides plenty of inside jokes and elements for parents and older members to enjoy that helps expand who will enjoy the movie.\n\n-Such a balance is what I loved in nineties movies and this film felt in touch with that balance.\n\nAction That Works Super Well -Surprisingly, I really loved the action of this film and found it to be one of the better sequences I've seen in a while.\n\n-The animation is a solid display of computer-generated imagery, with strong attention to detail to display the martial arts in an accurate manner.\n\n-Dynamic fight sequences unleash the tension of the moment and hold anime level quality of fast punches, wicked reversals, and physics defying finishers. All with that magical twist representative of the lore.\n\nDISLIKES:\n\nMore Of The Same -It's a great movie, but the fourth installment still is more of the same design and function as the others.\n\n-While the base is important, I would have enjoyed the movie adding that twist and edge that the first two movies held.\n\n-Or at least reintegrate the other characters a little better to help give a bit more climactic suspense into the movie and elevate the movie's inclusion of many new characters.\n\nA Rushed Finale -Another instance of timing issues, this film still struggled to perfect the final battle and finish.\n\n-Po's part they knocked out of the park, which was the saving grace of the movie. While the planning, character speeches and last-minute solutions were the weaker elements that needed another ten to fifteen minutes to make it worthwhile.\n\n-Even the touching speech at the end felt a tad drowned out by the quick wrap up, only saved by the transition to the fun credits and the promise something more could still come from this film.\n\nPredictable -No surprises here. King Fu Panda Four doesn't add too many twists or surprises that I could not predict early on in the film.\n\n-There isn't much more I can say. So don't expect any mind-blowing moments, but in a way it doesn't matter.\n\nTries A Tad Hard To Be Funny -And like always, Jack Black and the crew sometimes try a bit too hard to get a rise out of you.\n\n-Some lines are a tad over-emphasized, a little too much push to get the line out and get you to laugh.\n\n-Other running jokes become stale or annoying, never knowing when to quit. I suspect such antics will be enjoyed by kids, but viewers like me might just roll their eyes at the constant reiteration.\n\nThe VERIDCT: Kung Fu Panda's latest installment may not be the most unique experience I have had, but it certainly is one of the more fun movies I've gotten this year. Sticking to its roots, Po's story continues to be a fun adventure filled with family-friendly laughs and balanced storytelling for all ages to enjoy. Beautiful design and animation make the world come to life and strong voice acting helps to further develop the characters we've grown to love. And with action that is very fitting and perhaps some of the better fights I've seen in a long time, the movie accomplishes much in a shorter run time. Sure, a few twists could have broken up the monotony alongside better character usage. A less rushed ending also would have helped this movie end on the strongest foot it could with that wisdom meets humor, but the entertaining credits are a blessing.

Lisa Frankenstein is a film where the idea seemed fun, the people involved have made things I've enjoyed in the past, and the cast seemed to be having a great time, so what went wrong for me? Well, I think it all comes down to the fact that this movie is trying to be accessible to a wide age spectrum, but that made the movie lose a bit of its charm. This is easily a script that should've taken it one step further and been rated R. Many films have done similar premises to this one in the past, and while I won't say they were all better in concept, the final products say otherwise. Let me explain myself.\n\nTaking place in 1989, Lisa (Kathryn Newton), a teenager with a few questionable traits, wishes to be with someone who is dead and she has never met. His corpse is reanimated after she wishes upon his grave and a mysterious storm hits. From here, even though he can't speak, they become close and kind of psychotic. This very quickly becomes a twisted and messed up movie, but under the PG-13 banner, it just felt watered down. There are multiple instances when limbs are chopped off or people are murdered, and while it all is done in the spirit of having a good, weird time at the movies, it lacks the visuals of everything that was going on.\n\nKathryn Newton is quite enjoyable as Lisa and I wish the film had better dialogue for her because even though there is some clever writing and she made me laugh quite often, she is a much darker character than the PG-13 rating allowed her to be. Cole Sprouse (in my opinion) has honestly never been better though. He has no lines, but that made for some great physical acting. For a character without dialogue, he held his own against Newton here. Carla Gugino plays Lisa's stepmother and where that story leads is easily the highlight of the film, but again, every great idea this film had just felt watered down. I feel like a broken record talking about this one simply because I think this had all the bones of a great, fun, weird movie. There is also one scene in particular where I was laughing because I couldn't believe what I was watching, but the movie couldn't go far enough to show it actually happening. That was the majority of my experience here, even though the film was clever enough to be mildly enjoyable as it is.\n\nLook, Zelda Williams does a solid job at directing here, Diablo Cody's script is sharp, but does add the extra flare that was needed, I liked every performance, and it absolutely felt like it was from the '80s/'90s. Everyone did a very solid job bringing this screenplay to life. Everything about this movie from the set design to the bright, visual aesthetic all worked for me and should be commended, I just can't wrap my head around why this one wasn't rated R, especially considering certain things that happen or are implied here. It's a head-scratcher for me. I still had a good time though and I feel that the crowd that will like this one the most are teenagers in high school who get the humour.

The film, which seemingly aimed to blend horror elements with a quirky, colorful aesthetic, falls flat in nearly every aspect imaginable.\n\nThe plot is the first major casualty of this cinematic catastrophe. It meanders aimlessly, lacking both purpose and real meaning. Instead of engaging the audience with a coherent story, the film seems to stumble from one scene to the next, leaving viewers wondering what, if anything, the filmmakers were trying to convey. The attempts at weaving a narrative are so disjointed that any potential for substance is quickly lost in a sea of confusion.\n\nComedy, which could have served as the film's saving grace, instead adds to its downfall. The humor, if it can be called that, is so poorly executed that it fails to elicit even the slightest chuckle. It's a clear indication that the film struggles to find its identity, caught between wanting to be a comedic spoof and a genuine part of the horror genre it awkwardly tries to parody.\n\nThe acting further compounds the film's woes. It's rare to see a movie where the performances are uniformly lackluster, but Lisa Frankenstein manages this feat with disheartening success..\n\nUltimately, this is a film without substance. It's a hollow shell of a movie, lacking the creativity, wit, and emotional core necessary to make a lasting impact. The film's failure to deliver a meaningful plot, coupled with its unsuccessful attempts at humor and subpar acting, makes it a forgettable experience.

The opening credits' animation and creative sets are praiseworthy, and the dialogue exudes cleverness with a perfect dark comedy feel.

Lou, a cautious gym manager, has her world turned upside down when she develops feelings for Jackie, a dedicated bodybuilder in Las Vegas training for a competition (Katie O'Brian). Sparks fly, but their budding romance gets entangled with Lou's dark family secrets, propelling them down a violent path.\n\nLove Lies Bleeding isn't afraid to push boundaries. It evokes memories of classic thrillers like Body Double, with its neon-drenched aesthetic and underlying themes of obsession and desire. However, Glass injects a contemporary dose of female empowerment, subverting the stereotypical femme fatale trope. Jackie isn't just a damsel in distress; she's a complex character with her own agency, which adds a layer of intrigue to the narrative.\n\nThe film's greatest strength lies in its central performances. Stewart delivers a raw and intense portrayal of Lou, a woman yearning for connection but burdened by her past. O'Brian matches her intensity, embodying the steely determination and vulnerability of Jackie with remarkable nuance. Their chemistry is undeniable, making us invested in their tumultuous relationship, even as things spiral out of control.\n\nWhile the plot takes some wild turns, it's the film's thematic exploration that lingers. Glass dissects the destructive nature of desire, and the lengths people go to in the name of love-or perhaps, obsession. The violence, though brutal, feels purposeful, serving as a metaphor for the emotional turmoil the characters endure.\n\nAdmittedly, the pacing can be uneven at times. The first act establishes the characters and their connection beautifully, but the middle section drags a bit as the focus shifts towards the criminal underbelly. However, the film regains its momentum in the final act, culminating in a climax that's both shocking and strangely cathartic.\n\nTechnically, Love Lies Bleeding is a knockout. The cinematography is sharp, using bold colours and contrasting lighting to create a visually arresting world. The pounding score complements the film's intensity, while the editing keeps the narrative taut without sacrificing character development.\n\nLove Lies Bleeding isn't for the faint of heart. It's a film that revels in its own darkness, challenging us with its graphic violence and unconventional love story. But for those seeking a neo-noir experience that's both thrilling and thought-provoking, this is a film that will stay with you long after the credits roll.\n\nLove Lies Bleeding is a film with flaws, but its bold direction, phenomenal performances, and exploration of complex themes make it a worthwhile watch, especially for fans of unconventional thrillers.

With a dash of crime family drama.\n\nI found the cinematography of the movies to be quite impressive; it had a captivating aesthetic. Although it's not on an epic scale and mostly unfolds in remote settings, it's mesmerizingly filmed with themes of sex and violence. The characters are pretty good, so were the actors playing them. Kristen Stewart was Kristen Stewart, I think you already know what to expect when you see her in a movie, and I think she was pretty good.

Franco's character is probably the worst one.\n\nIt's also one of those movies where none of the characters are good people, it's just bad people making bad decisions, in the name of love.

Kristen Stewart's Father, played by Ed Harris, is a bad guy. But the backstory is so muddled, and unfocused it's hard to determine if Kristen is the villain or he is. Yes, he looks every bit like the bad guy. And acts as such. But he still seems to be missing scenes where he is the the bad dude.
