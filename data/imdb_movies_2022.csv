In this sense, I was a little disappointed that the film did not stay truer to the source material it was based on. I realize that they had to tell the story in a short period of time so it makes sense that they condensed it quite a bit and you do still get the sense that Laura is being pretty unreasonable with Massimo while he is trying to please her and do his \""job\"".

If you have \""triggers\"" or only want to see women respected in a safe environment...why are you watching a dark mafia romance? No one says that it has to be your taste. If you don't like it, don't watch it. No one is being forced. Do i believe women should be kidnapped? Absolutely not. Do I want to be kidnapped? Absolutely not.

Mossimo brings her family in for Christmas buying them gifts and Laura a fashion house to run. Then Laura sees what she thinks is Mossimo cheating on her with his ex and goes on the run with new character, \""Nacho\"" the new gardener.

However, perhaps people are starting to figure it out with the great Top Gun: Maverick and now A Christmas Story Christmas.\n\nOne of the things that is always worrisome is if they simply try and recreate those nostalgic moments. However, this movie finds ways to avoid those and create it's own new ones. For example, there is no forced scene where the oldest child has to wear the bunny outfit, or Ralphie getting a leg lamp, etc. In fact, the lamp, bunny outfit, Triple Dog Dare You and some other iconic moments are minimized and allowed to be left as memories for the characters the way they are for us.\n\nIt's far more emotional than I would have ever expected, acting as a fitting tribute to The Old Man and to Christmases of the past.\n\nRalphie still has an active imagination and there is one snowball fight daydream that is particularly funny.\n\nMost of the original cast is brought back with the one exception being Mrs. Parker.

Neha's character is badly written. The dialogues she delivers are seriously unrealistic. The blame is on the writers.\n\nNow the acting. I never thought Yami could over act but then I have never seen her take on a villain-ish role before. The slow motion, the BG music and tuning to that Yami's look where she tries to widen her eyes to look scarier makes her acting look like over acting. Atul is as usual brilliant but when you have a script so bad no Atul can save the film. The way Yami tries to be seated on a chair with an attitude of authority doesn't work. She doesn't make me digest the character of 'Naina Jaiswal' until the climax where she tries to show her authority and anger but Yami is good at emotional scenes in general and in this movie. Neha & Yami make me look away from the screen. The supporting actors & extras have done their job well.\n\nThe setting & writing is not real. The play school is in a deep residential area and I can digest that as my neighbor itself is a Montessori School & all I hear from their 'house' is a kid crying everyday - I want papa & a teacher shouting aloud 'red lobster' 'Onion' & what not. Here in the film all the kids love Yami. No one cries. No one wants to go back home. I personally don't know if play schools make children watch TV that too cartoon. Parents don't spend huge amounts so that their kids go to play schools and watch TV. Every play school has at least 3 'teachers', an HM/ Principal/ Manager and an 'aaya' who helps the kids with toilet, food, cleaning etc. I don't know where the writers based their play school from. Finland maybe?\n\nI recently watched a Kannada film titled 'Act 1978' where a pregnant woman holds a govt office hostage. The actress had done a commendable job to feel the pain of being pregnant while the stress on what she is doing increases. Neha on the other hand acts like she has gas.\n\nLike every film with unknown villains who provoke audience to understand the right reasons they fight for in wrong ways this film too with all its cliché-ness does the same, making us doubt in the very beginning that there must be a reason and a personal one. The climax is good and a painful one. But all's well that ends well doesn't work here. The climax is well done and written OK but the film in its entirety doesn't impress.\n\nIn short, Yami, Neha, dialogues and the screenplay have made this film a very much below average film even though the climax has its worthiness.

The kids' parents, the school's helper and the majority of the locality consider Naina as the perfect teacher who can control these little brats. The kids also love their Naina teacher. She plays with them, nurtures them, and show them their favourite cartoons. But as the kids start making noise, Naina shhh them with an evil gaze, and you get a hint that she has returned with ulterior motives.\n\nSoon, Naina informs the police that she has abducted 16 kids in her playschool, and she has some demands. Pregnant ACP Catherine Alvarez (Neha Dhupia), cancels her doctor appointment and reaches the playschool. Catherine tries to speak to Naina, but the latter asks for Javed Khan (Atul Kulkarni) for further negotiations. As Javed comes into the crime scene, we are set for a thrilling ride. Naina sets up an interesting game where multiple lives are endangered. Naina initiates a series of demands with Javed, from 5 Crore ranson money to a conversation with the Prime Minister of India. Within no time, Naina creates havoc in the city.\n\nWhat makes 'A Thursday' interesting is that the film quickly jumps into thriller mode. Within 10 minutes of the film, we get to see a sweet-loving Naina, turned into a cold-hearted, ruthless kidnapper. It's a no-nonsense thriller that keeps you interested till the end. As the film hits the interval, you will feel to get back quickly to see what will happen next. The film addresses a burning issue and the need-of-the-hour to eradicate it. But apart from that, it also takes a dig at the work ethics of media professionals. How social media craves negativity. How the netizens consider a 'game of death' entertaining.\n\nThere are a few moments in the film, where you be astonished and scared at the same time. Like at one instance, Naina asks the kids to form a circle and recite 'Twinkle Twinkle' with their eyes shut. As the innocent souls start singing, Naina records them in her phone with a gun pointing at them. In another nail-biting scene, Yami gets into a fight, and it is layered by the background score of a lullaby, that's another cinematic moment that will keep you hooked. Even the climactic twist will surprise you in a big way.\n\nTalking about performances, Yami Gautam Dhar has stunned us with her act. Yami's pretty eyes echo chaos. She emotes pain, despair, anxiety, anger, hatred with sincere conviction. It's hard to believe that a beautiful face like Yami can be so ruthless, could shoot a child with zero regrets. This is the most challenging character for her, but the actress aced it with flying colours. Atul Kulkarni's role of inspector Javed Khan instantly connects with the audience, as he portrays it with utmost realism. His presence, his dialogue delivery, and the variety he showcased in his act make us realise his absence from the big screen.\n\nNeha Dhupia deserves special mention as she played the role of ACP Cathrine with commendable sincerity and perfection. Neha was pregnant during the shoot, but she took this challenge to showcase her acting chops. The film is set during the monsoons, and Neha does some hardcore thrilling moments in the midst of rain. That's where you realise that she's a performer at par. Karanvir Sharma plays the role of Naina's fiance Karan Mirchandani. Even though he had a short stint, he gives it a praiseworthy performance. Last but not the least, Dimple Kapadia shines as the Prime Minister, Maya Rajguru. Dimple's character thinks from heart, and she feels for the lives of the children. Maya prefers emotions over protocols, and clearly mention not being a puppet.\n\nDirector Behzad Khambata has made sure to keep the film as crisp as possible. The film has no songs, it ditched melodrama, and although Naina's demands look unreal, her motive makes it believable. The background score of Kaizad Gherda goes in sync with thrilling moments, and it makes it more interesting.\n\nA THURSDAY is a song-less film. Roshan Dalal and Kaizad Gherda's background score is one of the USPs of the film and contributes to the thrill factor very well. Anuja Rakesh Dhawan and Siddharth Vasani's cinematography is very good. Madhusudan N's production design is rich. Ayesha Khanna's costumes are realistic and non-glamourous, as per the demands of the script. The same goes for Vikram Dahiya's action. Sumeet Kotian's editing could have been tighter towards the beginning of the second half but overall, it's good.\n\nOn the whole, A THURSDAY springs a huge surprise. It is laced with a taut script, first-rate execution and the finest performance ever by Yami Gautam Dhar. It's a film that should have ideally come in cinemas. Had it been released on the big screen, especially in the Women's Day week, it would have emerged as the sleeper hit of the year, if not the sleeper super-hit.

And, regrettably, the debut feature from writer-director Charlotte Wells delivers more of the latter than the former. This melancholic character study tells the story of a woman (Celia Rowlson-Hall) who looks back 20 years to a vacation that her perky 11-year-old self (Frankie Corio) took with her young and loving but quietly troubled father (Paul Mescal). In doing so, it explores the subjects of memory, parent-child relationships, mental and emotional well-being, and the various senses of loss we all experience over time, topics that the protagonist's youthful counterpart may not have fully understood at the time but that her adult self now does. I wish I could say the same for myself, though; I often felt that I was being tasked to construct a narrative for the picture myself, based, essentially, on merely what was being shown to me, material that frequently comes across as underdeveloped and open to an array of interpretation in terms of both story line and character development. To put it simply, I didn't feel I was given enough substance to work with to accomplish that task, and it often left me feeling wanting, abandoned by the filmmaker, and, ultimately, uninterested. And, to complicate matters further, the film's poor sound quality regularly obscures the characters' dialogue behind their thick Scottish accents, and its often-dark, overly muddled cinematography made some images difficult to decipher at times. What's more, this offering's camera work - aimed at simulating glorified home movies, a fitting approach for telling this story - is packed with innocuous material. Indeed, who really cares about sitting through endless footage of the characters engaging in mundane activities like playing video games, eating ice cream and attempting to sing karaoke? The \""looking back in fondness\"" factor in these supposedly touching segments is a little too inane to engender truly heart-tugging feelings, constituting cinematic padding more than anything integral or meaningful to the overall story.

To an extent.\n\nI'm no war buff so I'll leave the realism to the experts but what this movie does is show you the first World War from the view point of people who've never experienced or even conceived of war and bloodshed on this scale. It starts off with new recruits full of patriotism for their country expecting to be sent on a grand adventure only to have those expectations quickly shattered. Turns out war isn't fun, and not even initially due to the actual fighting. Just training and constantly being screamed at and controlled while marching your days away is brutal. Remember, while vehicles existed, they weren't common use at this period of time...these soldiers had to walk, walk, and walk some more to get to where the war effort was taking place. And even if they had vehicles most of those places didn't have roads yet to drive them on. Then there's the constant lack of food and water, rough sleeping conditions, being exposed to the elements. Just GETTING to the war is brutal. That's a good 3rd of the movie right there.\n\nThen close to the half way point, after a few minor skirmishes, we see the war front and the trenches and get to see what that's like. Well...it's terrible! You pop up out of a trench and boom...you're shot. And that's just life in between charges. There was no strategy to the charges either, they relied on waves of bodies to gain even 100 meters, hoping to out pace the bullets constantly coming your way. Millions of young men died in this fashion, their bodies littering the field.\n\nThe most brutal part of the film is the weapons of war never before seen. Tanks, flame throwers, planes dropping bombs. Men screaming in pure terror while the bullet proof tanks drive over them, while flames fill their trenches, or planes blow them up while they flee.\n\nAnd the odd thing is since we're seeing it from the eyes of the young German soldiers, who are truly clueless as to why they're really even fighting, you do empathize and feel sorry for them. You find yourself even rooting for them. This movie humanizes them but importantly shows the politicians who are truly to blame for the atrocities. The powerful men behind the scenes, bloated from being overfed on rich foods, hundreds of miles away from the pain and suffering they cause.\n\nI have no idea how accurate this movie is but it's a pretty straight forward piece showing just how awful, terrifying, and destructive this period of time was.

But here, there's no dignity in anything that transpires; obstacles aren't admirably overcome, the ensemble don't conduct themselves in a way which is befitting of their station, worthy of respect & none of the characters win any semblance of what could honestly be described as \""glory\""... They're just young, impressionable fools - drunk on propaganda - who have mindlessly partaken in the unwarranted military occupation of foreign land, where they are obviously not welcome by the inhabitants. Due to this, there's a void of relatability & moreover, all the team of participants can dream of - once they arrive at the front - or endeavour to guarantee for themselves is survival, not greatness.\n\nHowever, despite this inability to sympathise being an irksome grievance of mine, in the production's defense, I suppose that's actually intentional & rather the whole point (?), since it's meant to tell the story through the perspective of the vanquished, not the conquerors, reflecting how naive recruits (who'd been fatally misled, in conscripting themselves & their families in the first place) were gradually numbed to their feelings by the constant mental & physical anguish inflicted upon them in a continuous onslaught of pointless offensives (instigated by their generals), once reality had firmly bitten & they'd been collectively disabused of this fantasy - but unfortunately, that noticeable detachment from any of the characters featured results in a somewhat muted response (as a viewer) when they're incessantly chewed up & spat out by the gratuitous violence - that's shot in a hauntingly raw, ominous way - they're repeatedly (& needlessly) thrust in to by the callous, cowardly officers, who arrogantly orchestrate the entire miserable situation that needn't last a single day longer.\n\nAgain, I suppose that only reaffirms the statement the creators are trying to make, wilfully juxtaposing intense sequences of suffering & pain with little sentimentality & ambivalence; the film chronicles how Germany treated (or more accurately, mistreated) its own people, offering up generations of its future citizens on the battlefield as sacrificial lambs, massacred at the altar of a poisonous, nationalistic ideology which had taken root within the governing population; boys - barely men, even some who weren't yet - were essentially reduced to nothing but disposable, unimportant objects, thoughtlessly discarded & simply replaced in a sadistic game & quest for absolute power (no matter the personal cost or price paid in blood) - an incalculable loss which (even by the time the armistice came in to effect) still wasn't enough to satiate the tyrannical desires of the few, controlling the many... And the movie does therefore (to its credit) accurately reflect that exact point in its portrayal of the poor cannon fodder by representing them as exactly that, & additionally lenses the apathy of the superiors (who give the indefensible orders) through a perspective of rightful, scornful contempt.\n\nHence, I can understand the creative intentions (depicting the utter, irredeemable meaninglessness; the wanton, senseless destruction) & the grim inhumanity of it all... Yet after seeing such horrors & heinous cruelties, I guess I felt like I wanted a purpose to everything I'd sat through by the time the credits started rolling - & thought I'd been cheated by the fact that there wasn't one. On the other hand, like I acknowledge earlier, I assume that's not accidental - & rather the understandably cynical, bitter & despondent conclusion the narrative decidedly wants the audience to come to by the time it reaches its unsatisfactory denouement; there is no discernible reason that could ever hope to justify the carnage we observe - the savagery that unfolds is simply slaughter for the sheer sake of it & the trauma experienced by all those affected was utterly preventable, had the invaders put aside their vanity & pride & sought to preserve peace which could've so effortlessly been maintained.\n\nPlus, it does also show one massive miscalculation on the side of the victors; forcing the Germans in to reluctant submission & backing them in to signing an agreement with terms they couldn't accept would ultimately entrench resentful animosity that would act as a spark to light the fire of the 2nd World War, only a few decades later etc. Foreshadowing what was to come before anyone could predict the oncoming calamity. Due to this, irrespective of what I think (or more aptly, how little it evoked within me), I must concede that it remains a success, regardless - because the project undoubtedly achieved its goal in a commendably brutal & unflinching manner - & I can't plausibly surmise any alternative which would've resulted in something better."", ""Upvotes"": ""278"", ""Downvotes"": ""102"", ""Reviewer"": ""W011y4m5""}, {""Title"": ""Great adaptation and remake"", ""Rating"": ""8"", ""Review Content"": ""Germany, May 1917. 17-year-old Paul Baumer enthusiastically enlists in the German army and heads off to war.

It was quite revolutionary, depicting the horrific reality of war rather than the glamourous, sanitised version. In a sense it was the first anti-war novel. It was so unflinching in its portrayal of WW1 that the Nazi party regarded it as treasonous and had the book banned and stripped Remarque of his German citizenship, causing him to flee to Switzerland and ultimately the US.\n\nIn 1930 Hollywood made the book into a movie. It was superb, capturing well the horrors that Remarque depicted in his book. It deservedly won the Oscar for Best Picture (and Best Director) in 1930.\n\nIn 1979 it was adapted again, this time as a made-for-TV movie. Despite being directed by Delbert Mann and boasting a star-studded cast (Richard Thomas, Ernest Borgnine, Ian Holm, Donald Pleasance) this version was far from being in the same league as the 1930 version and didn't do the book justice.

Sure there were undeniably powerful moments, but they were overshadowed by all over-stylization and lesser involving narrative that we've all seen in more inspiring war films. All three writers seemed to enjoy long sequences where very little of interest happens, and the little interest there is, is milked to the maximum time.\n\nIf this was cut down to about a 90 min runtime, the tension and suspense would be more appreciated and the narrative more engaging.

But the plot quickly unravels as the narrative loses focus and becomes bogged down in cell phone records and endless flashbacks to the two main character's relationship. This is the core of the story, and it's supposed to lay the groundwork for the big reveal at the end, but the two leads have little to no chemistry, the love scenes and romance has no spark, and therefore the entire emotional core of the story falls apart.\n\nAs the plot meanders on from flashback to flashback, it becomes more and more ludicrous. Never mind that the CIA would never allow lovers working in the field like this, no one except Laurence Fishbourne feels like a CIA agent. The side characters are just window dressing with the exception of Johnathan Pryce, who get show off his acting chops in one scene.\n\nThe response to the hijackers is ludicrous, as is the entire story about how the Germans or Austrians don't want to release 5 prisoners. Ridiculous. Neither of these countries would risk a plane full of people being killed on the internet over 5 prisoners they could easily track after release. Never mind that they don't actually hold high profile terrorists in those countries.\n\nEven more ridiculous is the plot about the Informant in Russia, naturally an entirely innocent man.\n\nThis is where the obligatory amazon wokeness comes in. Aside from one, the white characters are all either corrupt or killers. The non-white characters are predictably flawless and blameless. And of course the Russians are portrayed as pure evil again.\n\nEven more ridiculous is a line about a character dying in Iran because they don't have medicine there due to western sanctions. Who writes this garbage? Iran has better medical care than most middle eastern nations and a life expectancy of 77 which is higher than most East European nations and only 2 years lower than the US. Sanction against Iran don't even include medical products.\n\nAs mentioned the portrayal of the CIA is ludicrous as well, presenting them like some incompetent squad of hobbyist hitmen who sell out innocent informants at a whim and kill their own agents in elaborate theatrical setups over a phone call instead of bringing them in for questioning.\n\nWhat good is there to say about the film?

There is about 10 minutes of setup, followed by 2 hours of action and/or suspense. Thirty minutes into the movie I felt like I just watched the climax action scene. I was wondering where the movie could possibly go from there, but there was no need to worry. It took me for a ride.

I'm telling you this for the simple, following reason. Once I'd done just a -little- bit of research on the matter, but only -AFTER- having viewed said movie .....{ I'd had absolutely -no- idea of this entire 'True History' aspect of Amsterdam whatsoever prior to my viewing of it ; I'd just ( -wrongly- ) assumed that it was going to be entirely fictional ; like say, most other theatrical offerings available out there over the course of an average moviegoing week }..... my appreciation for veteran director David O. Russell's massive, ambitious \""Period Caper\"" immediately started to grow, A N D -{ T R E M E N D O U S L Y }- S O.\n\n______________________________________________________\n\nThe picture was in -FACT- inspired in whole by the \""BUSINESS PLOT\"" ; a 1933 political conspiracy in which a veritable HANDFUL -{ literally! }- of \""uberwealthy\"" American bankers and businessmen plotted a military coup d'état to overthrow widely Beloved US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt . . . . . { often referred to affectionately as simply \""FDR\"", and -immensely- revered by his base for the many Progressive Policies that he enacted ; including SEVERAL that resulted in uplifting the lives of -multiple- minority groups in America, over the course of his 'enormous' 12 year tenure } . . . . . And replace him with a truly malicious and fascist Veterans' Organization ; headed by a Marine Corps Major General by the name of Smedley Butler. -This- particular narrative account of the events in question relates the goings-on from the perspective of three \""MADLY\"" loyal friends, who get unwittingly drawn -{ right }- into the mayhem. The parts are played to utter PERFECTION, ( and then some! ), by Margot Robbie, Christian Bale & John David Washington ( leading man of \""Tenet\"", and real-life son to none other than Denzel Washington ). And finally, without further ado, that leads me to this: a bit of sincere, friendly advice to you. If you're someone who DOESN'T appreciate one or more of the three characteristics listed below, ALL of which are -{ specific }- to Amsterdam ; then be assured, this particular film will very likely -{ NOT }- be 'right up your alley'. Here goes. 1. Long-Playing ( albeit very comically enriched ) dramas, that -REALLY- take their time to build up their respective storytelling arcs, and do so in a -genuinely- \""Relaxed And Unrushed\"" manner, at that ( a production sensibility that - I - for one, have always -truly- appreciated ). 2. Quite simply put: PERIOD PIECES that have \""that distinct Oscar contender\"" feel to them ( in general ). 3. Movies that try & show \""The Best In Us\"", and that break down RACE BARRIERS, ( as well as other socially iniquitous barriers like the altogether unfounded fear, and prejuduce, of \""the other\"" ), in the most Tender, Poignant, And Often HEARTMELTING of ways.\n\nSUMMARY: If, on the flip side, you're -{ NOT }- likely to be fazed by -any- of the three aforementioned salient aspects of Amsterdam { \""Good On You, Yay!\"" } ; -and- its 'decidedly non-cursory' runtime of about 135 minutes doesn't intimidate you ( -EITHER- ) ; then you're in for a \""mindbogglingly entertaining\"" festival of -genuinely dazzling- . . . \""Star Power\"", to the tune of FIFTEEN MAGNIFICENT A-LISTERS, no less!

Sometimes no matter how hard we try to like a movie, it simply doesn't work for us. In those instances, I typically attempt to focus on what I did like and offer an explanation of why it fell short of expectations. And it's that word, \""expectations\"", that is usually the culprit. High expectations often lead to disappointment, whereas 'low' or 'no' expectations at least have a shot of ending up a pleasant surprise. So when the writer-director of SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK (2012) and THE FIGHTER (2010) rolls out his first film in seven years, and his cast is filled with Oscar winners, Oscar nominees, and other talented actors ... well, high expectations are in order. Unfortunately, so is the disappointment.\n\nDavid O Russell is the filmmaker noted above, and despite some disturbing accusations made against him recently, his cinematic track record and ability to attract deep and talented casts and crews make his new project something to check out. This one is inspired by the true story of a1933 political conspiracy, and that's where the story begins before flashing back to 1918 and ultimately returning to 1933. It's during the flashback where we see the beginnings of the friendship between Burt Berendsen (Oscar winner Christian Bale) and Harold Woodman (John David Washington). It's here that we also witness the presence of racism in the military during the Great War. When Burt and Harold are injured, they are cared for by nurse Valerie Voze (Margot Robbie). Harold and Valerie fall in love, and third wheel Burt joins them as a roommate in Amsterdam, where they live a blissful bohemian existence ... right up until Burt returns home to his wife and Valerie vanishes.\n\nReturning to 1933, we find Burt is a doctor experimenting with multiple medical options focused on injured war veterans, and Harold is a distinguished lawyer. Burt has a scarred face and glass eye from his war injuries, and Harold has been contacted by the daughter (Taylor Swift) of their former commanding officer (Ed Begley Jr). The daughter suspects foul play in the death of her father, who was scheduled to give a speech at an upcoming military reunion gala. Ms. Swift's appearance is in fact swift, and leads to the murder and scandalous autopsy findings.\n\nGoing through all that happens next would be as convoluted on paper as it was on screen. There are so many characters and so many story lines and so many familiar faces that the film couldn't possibly be expected to flow smoothly. And it doesn't. A mention of some of the supporting cast includes standout Anya Taylor-Joy as the wife of filthy rich Tom Voze played by (Oscar winner) Rami Malek. When the murder occurs, Burt and Harold are the prime suspects of the detectives played by Matthias Schoenaerts and Alessandro Nivola. Andrea Riseborough plays Burt's estranged and ultra-snobby wife Beatrice, while Chris Rock is another old war buddy of our wrongfully accused murder suspects. Robert DeNiro (another Oscar winner) plays General Gil Dillenbeck (who we learn is based on real life Major General Smedley Butler). Others making an appearance include: Michael Shannon and Mike Myers as American and British spies, Timothy Olyphant as an undefined henchman, Zoe Saldana as the autopsy nurse, and the always dependable Colleen Camp and Beth Grant. Now you understand what I mean by so many characters and familiar faces.\n\nAll of the actors are as strong as you would expect. Mr. Bale and Ms. Robbie go \""big\"", while Mr. Washington stays in a low-key mode for balance. The film has an unusual look through the camera of 3-time Oscar winning cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, and seems to be filled with an endless stream of close-ups shot upward at the subject's face. It's not a whodunnit since we see the crime happen, and instead is more of a \""we must solve the case to avoid prison\"" - kind of a quasi-comedy caper film, only they aren't trying to get away with anything. It's also not quite a farce, and is a madcap with a shortage of \""mad\"". We see the power play between various factions that catches the unsuspecting types in the crosshairs, while raising points of fascism, antisemitism, and racism. The film meanders when it's not downright choppy, and it often plays like a scripted series trying too hard to appear improvisational. I believe the message is the power of friendship and love wins over the lust for power, however it's hard to know for sure. Drake as an Executive Producer adds an element of interest, but as a movie, this one mostly falls flat despite the efforts of a sterling cast.\n\nOpens in theaters on October 7, 2022."", ""Upvotes"": ""241"", ""Downvotes"": ""243"", ""Reviewer"": ""ferguson-6""}, {""Title"": ""Love, murder and conspiracy"", ""Rating"": ""4"", ""Review Content"": ""Really tried to like this and with a cast that stellar you can't be blamed for having high hopes.

What Maneesh Sharma and Shah Rukh Khan's \""Fan\"" (2016) and Prithviraj Sukumaran and Suraj Venjaramoodu's \""Driving Licence\"" (2019) missed, An Action Hero got it right - a concrete theory to set up a clash between a star and a local man (here he is a big politician though). However, it goes over the top in the second half to make you believe that at the end it's just a Bollywood film, so the hero has to win. It does go wrong there, and some larger-than-life theories spoil it a little. An unexpected dose of comedy with organic humour is pleasant, whereas unnecessary heroism and grand theories halt it on an average level.\n\nMaanav Khurana (Ayushmann Khurrana) is a film star with the image of an action hero. He has some connections with bad people that involve him in the accidental death of Bhoora's (Jaideep Ahlawat) brother. Maanav flies out of the country to avoid police arrest and investigation, but little does he know that Bhoora is a bigger threat than the cops. The conversation between Maanav and Bhoora takes them on a rollercoaster chase in London, and then there are big surprises in the second half, mentioned above as 'grand theories'. Who is the hero and who's the villain? Or are they both not what they seem? And most importantly, who wins at the end?\n\nAnirudh Iyer's story starts off on a promising note, but it is a faulty script for today's audiences. A hero is nothing without a villain, and in the same way, a villain is useless if there is no hero to oppose him. We all know these basic rules, and that's what millions of mainstream audiences have been watching over the years. An intellectual face-off like \""The Dark Knight\"" (2008) comes once in decades or maybe a millennium. And in Indian cinema, we have hardly managed to match half of that with \""Ayyappanum Koshiyum\"" (2020). Anirudh couldn't grab that creativity while exploring the heroism of the hero and somewhere of the villain as well. His sense of humour in taking a dig at the media and stars is splendid, though (me, being a media person, saying this, can you believe it?). Also, the humour and comedy are far from the mediocrity that our so-called blockbuster films and directors show.\n\nAyushmann Khurrana has had a dull year, but not as a performer. A couple of years ago, he changed the face of Bollywood with his pathbreaking choices, and all of them became box office hits. Now, in the post-Covid-19 era, things have changed, as has the fate of his films, and the audience has become a little bit more choosy than they were before. An Action Hero gives him a heroic image and does a good job. Jaideep Ahlawat is freaking good, as it seems he is in his own zone, being a powerful politician with a lot of attitude and ego. He looks like a perfect fit for the role, and you'll like his jokes because they have a Haryanavi flavour. The supporting cast adds more to this fun ride, while Akshay Kumar's cameo will surprise you. The two dancing divas, Malaika Arora and Nota Fatehi, appear in two songs, and they set the dance floor on fire with their super sexy looks and brilliant dancing skills.\n\nTalking about the technical aspects, An Action Hero is an enriching experience. The background score is excellent, the cinematography is superb, and the editing is edgy. The screenplay is pacy, excluding the last 20 minutes when you know that you are close to the conclusion and you start predicting the fates of the characters. Director Anirudh Iyer has a great sense of cinema, even though it's his own writing that pulls down An Action Hero. But as a director, he is surprisingly good and damn promising. You'll have to see how he has presented all those action scenes and the face off between Ayushmann and Jaideep. The dialogues are used smartly. He has planned things cleverly, and his knowledge about scene-making is simply too much for a newcomer. If it hadn't been for the writing, An Action Hero would have been a solid debut for him. Nevertheless, it's a decent film that has unnecessarily gone into the exaggeration zone.\n\nRATING - 5/10*\n\nBy - #samthebestest."", ""Upvotes"": ""30"", ""Downvotes"": ""29"", ""Reviewer"": ""SAMTHEBESTEST""}, {""Title"": ""An utter garbage!"", ""Rating"": ""1"", ""Review Content"": ""An utter garbage like what did I watch!

He has given back-to-back content-driven films, which no other Bollywood actor from his generation has managed to do. He has always chosen the right subject, and every time it was a different topic. With Anek, he has brought a new topic to light, but the film eventually goes dim. Ayushmann and Anubhav Sinhaa's previous outing, \""Article 15\"" (2019), is one of my favourite films from recent times and undoubtedly the best work of the duo to date. Anek brings them together for another important and serious topic, but the duo fails to deliver what we were expecting from them.\n\nThe film deals with a hard-hitting subject which has been untouched till date, but goes wrong with the storytelling that hasn't got anything for the regular moviegoers. A wannabe patriotic film with no jingoism. Well, that's not the main issue, but it's an issue anyway. The biggest issue is the slow-paced narrative that fails to hold your attention. Anek is a socio-political action thriller set against the geopolitical backdrop of Northeast India. However intricate that sounds, while reading, the film is one step ahead in complexity. The film focuses on an undercover cop, Aman aka Joshua (Ayushmann Khurrana), who is on a mission to restore peace in the Northeastern region of India. Aida (Andrea Kevichüsa) is a talented boxer who has been humiliated for years as a non-Indian due to the culture and appearance of the north-east. Joshua encourages her to play for India while he is being dragged into a political conspiracy that intends to keep the war going. It's his opinion vs. Political decisions, but there are a lot of dedal speeches that make it a powerful story. However, the screenplay is too slow to count you in for a show as you almost find it as effective as a sleeping pill.\n\nAyushmann Khurrana has given many fine performances, and with each film he has raised the bar for himself. With Anek, he doesn't raise it higher, but certainly remains on his own level. The character of Aman/Joshua hasn't got enough shade to show him his calibre. He has one accent and one attitude throughout the film, which is too common for an 'undercover cop'. There are no such intelligent moves for either, which could have made his character much more interesting and versatile. Nevertheless, he carries the entire film on his shoulder, and that's enough for this lacklustre film. Andrea Kevichüsa gets a forgettable role in her debut. Can't say horrible, but her character is not accessible for the common viewer. It's not just the accent but the entire personality that keeps it away from the mainstream audience, and after all the struggle, all it has to offer is predictable drama. Manoj Pahwa was such a gem in Article 15, but here his talent has been wasted. Or maybe the intricate structure of the character made it look so? Not sure. It's such a complex mix, even from the writer's perspective, that you don't connect with any of the supporting characters in the film. Deeplina Deka, J. D. Chakravarthy, Kumud Mishra and Loitongbam Dorendra are decent, but nothing that stays in your mind.\n\nThe technical aspects of Anek have fared better than expected. The background score works well on a few occasions, with a few irritating overloud segments. Also, the action sequences are too real, hence they feel like documentary footage. Ewan Mulligan's camerwork is fine, whereas Anurag Saikia's songs have found the essence but not the beats. Anek could've been easily trimmed, but it's the same name again that makes it dull. Yasha Ramchandani's editing made Thappad a pretty boring affair, and Anek has joined the same club. One strong point is dialogue. Hard-hitting and meaningful.\n\nAnubhav Sinhaa is one such director I started to look up to when he delivered back-to-back good films like \""Mulk\"" (2018) and \""Article 15\"" (2019) after films like \""Cash\"" (2007), \""Ra. One\"" (2011) and \""Tum Bin 2\"" (2016). But then he lost the form with \""Thappad\"" (2020), despite putting his hands into another challenging subject, and now Anek makes it two in a row. First, it's Sinhaa's writing at fault here, then it's direction. Anek seems so clueless and off track for more than half of its runtime that you can't make head or tail of it. The new characters suddenly come into the picture, some suddenly disappear, and most of the time, it's the linear equation that seems lost. Anubhav Sinha repeats the same mistake. He keeps his narrative too serious and intense, unnecessarily. Also, the long runtime makes it a boring seminar. Anek has no commercial appeal at all, but it doesn't even have that much artistic value to be called a good attempt at art cinema. As a whole, the film has an important concept but fails to live up to the hype that the subject needed. If you loved Thappad, then you'll like Anek too, but if you loved Article 15 more, then it's better you watch the same film again.\n\nRATING - 4/10*"", ""Upvotes"": ""36"", ""Downvotes"": ""54"", ""Reviewer"": ""SAMTHEBESTEST""}, {""Title"": ""Movie Based on Anubhav Sinha's Mentality"", ""Rating"": ""1"", ""Review Content"": ""Did they talk about Britisher Dr. Elwin who was made the in charge of North east affairs after Independence?

Argentina seeks its third Oscar by resorting to the same formula over and over again: In 1976, a group of generals overthrew Argentina's government and began a campaign of terror against the population ( See La Historia Oficial and El secreto de sus ojos). The problem seems to be that much of the tension and drama depend on empathy with the character of Darín, a superficial and adrift character, but at the same time cold with the world. Dissatisfaction with life makes his anguish turn into ugliness. The expression \""boring people are boring\"" comes to mind.

Of course the trial itself is historically significant, but that's not really making a movie.\n\nIt's quite ... fine. It does the basics.

A lot of the scenes are just people eating, smoking, looking at stuff, looking sad, talking about their worries. Everything is stretched out to fill out the runtime.

I didn't watch too much, it's true, but it doesn't nullify the quality of this production. It's an Argentinian film made for Argentinians, but it can talk a lot not only with Brazil, but also with almost the entire South America. Brazil, Chile, Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay were also under military dictatorships between the 1960s and 1980s.

In \""Argentina, 1985\"" I experienced the best of these two productions, and two names are responsible: Santiago Mitre and Ricardo Darín.\n\nMitre's direction is extraordinary, it's never manipulative, the entire atmosphere of the movie is brilliantly constructed, and he extracts the best of the most important actor in Argentina. Darín is superb, the audience can feel that he's carrying possibly the heaviest burden in Argentina's history. He's doing an honest job and his dynamic with Peter Lanzani is marvelous. Julio Strassera and Luis Moreno Ocampo are not only promoters, the film explores them as humans, and the supporting cast is perfect at this function. There are no archetypes here, all characters are humans.\n\nAnother thing that surprised me is the film's pace and tone. Sometimes funny, mostly tense and integrally immersive, it's fast when it needs and slow when it needs. I always used to be bored watching scenes in a courtroom.\n\nUna producción extraordinaria y yo creo que \""nunca más\"" volvamos a tener otra película con ese nível de valor. Muchas veces los nombres de las personas envolvidas son cambiados para evitar acciones judiciales, pero el coraje del equipo y el tono adoptado por Mitre hacen que esta historia sea acessible al público en general y permiten contarla en un film que no es un documental, algo que difícilmente ocurriería en Estados Unidos.\n\nThis last paragraph needed to be in Spanish, I needed to make reference to the words most spoken by the Argentine people in that time.

After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.\n\nAs someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.\n\nFirst of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.\n\nVisually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.\n\nStory-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).\n\nThere's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned.

The opening sequence is a sight to behold and had me mesmerized with its vibrant energy. The film chugs along at a good pace for the next two hours to the point I really didn't feel the runtime for most of it. It's the last hour or so where Chazelle loses the story a bit.

I wanted to credit Damien Chazelle and his team for providing a unique experience in regards to pacing, setting and tone. The expression \""fever dream\"" is overused but Babylon is captured in such a chaotic and constantly shifting way that kept me enraptured. The movie looks fantastic and even if you don't have an interest in this period of cinema, I don't doubt that Babylon will still pull you in. The costuming and sets are dynamic and show how disorganized and tumultuous early Hollywood was. I was hooked from the get-go and for all the movie's flaws, its presentation is vibrant and fast-moving to keep help you entertained.\n\nWhile Babylon is distinctive with its look and pacing, when it comes to the characters, things are a little more familiar. Conrad and LaRoy are loosely based on a couple of people from that era but the lessons the movie wants to teach us about Hollywood chewing up and spitting out talent are pretty routine. I think Babylon is effective at getting those across but I was a little let down that the movie starts so bombastically and then quietly tip toes into conventionality by the end. Some characters are meant to be less distinctive (Manny is the audience avatar for example) but while I wish they were a little more fresh, I did want to follow them throughout the length of the movie.\n\nDamien Chazelle has enough of a name now that he could probably get any actor/actress he wanted in his cast. He still attracted some big and interesting names for Babylon. I think every member of the main cast did a fantastic job and it's a credit to them and Chazelle for getting the most out of his performers. Brad Pitt's the biggest name and I really enjoyed the work he put in as Jack Conrad. He's appropriately funny in Conrad's lush and over-the-top behaviour but he garners some genuine sympathy for him when the world turns against him. Pitt could have played it so big that he came off as an entitled prick but there's some warmth and passion to Conrad and Pitt gets that across. I've always liked Margot Robbie and she's on point here as Nellie. She throws herself into it completely, there's a surprising amount of physicality and nuance in Nellie's whirlwind behaviour. Much like Pitt, she's really funny when she is given the opportunity to be. Despite the pretty telegraphed arc for her character, you understand why Manny can't resist Nellie even when it's crystal clear she's bad news wrapped in pretty packaging. I would hope that Pitt and Robbie both get awards consideration for their work here. Diego represents the audience, he's witnessing all the craziness and has to go along with it. He's a pretty blank slate but there's enough from Diego that his character is distinct and you understand his motivations. I want to credit Li Jun Li and Jovan Adepo as Lady Fay Zhu and Sidney Palmer respectively. Their characters are written with a heavy hand but both are sympathetic and have their respective moments. The oddest casting is Tobey Maguire as threatening mobster James McKay but Maguire's surprisingly good at being a creepy underworld figure.\n\nGetting to the negatives, Babylon is a movie that indulges in the exact same vices that it's lambasting. As a film, Babylon's determined to show all excess and hedonism of the era in all its \""glory.\"" I appreciated some of this but there are moments where the movie gets pretty gross (there's an early scene involving a elephant that is going to shock people) and while I get what Chazelle and his team are trying to show, was it really necessary? I'd argue not. Babylon's lengthy run time is also going to drive some people away but it also has an affect on how the story twists and turns. Characters that started out with more depth gradually turn more generic (Nellie specifically comes to mind) and you could have easily trimmed some of the fat off this movie. The total length of Babylon feels a little self-indulgent and while the previously mentioned frenetic pace keeps you guessing, it saps some of the ending's impact. I got what the movie was trying to say with its wrap-up but I can't deny I was bouncing in my seat in anticipation of getting to leave.\n\nJust like the lavish and insane partying that Babylon presents, you have to choose to take the hit of whatever your poison of choice is and dive in headfirst or not to indulge and slip out the back. Babylon is going to be an incredibly polarizing film and while I enjoyed large parts of this movie, there were also many scenes that fell flat for me. I'd grade Babylon somewhere between a 7 and an 8 but I'm rounding up because there are moments where Babylon has some real cinematic magic.

Damien Chazelle has called Babylon: \""A hate letter to Hollywood and a love letter to movies,\"" but his messy, dazzling epic doesn't support that simplistic idea. Set in the early days of cinema, when talking pictures were a jaw-dropping phenomenon and Hollywood was still being created, Babylon suggests a deeper reality: the film industry's raw, self-destructive, narcissistic impulses and its glorious, magical results have always been opposite parts of the same whole. Chazelle's ambitions are huge. Babylon is full of remarkable set pieces with richly drawn characters, music, dancing, love and betrayal. The film's strengths more than make up for its serious flaws, including too many endings and a wrong-headed reliance on Singin' in the Rain as a touchstone. But if Babylon makes you groan occasionally, there are many more times long, exhilarating stretches that are mesmerising. In one of the film's multiple endings, which leaps ahead to 1952, a major character sits in a cinema tearfully watching Singin' in the Rain. That enamoured-of-movies scene hasn't been fresh since Sullivan's Travels in 1941, not to mention Cinema Paradiso in 1988 and this year's Empire of Light. The fact that the scene can be viewed as a homage to all those films doesn't make it less cliched. And a montage of other movies through history is a bravura but needless coda. At its best, Chazelle's film is a cinematic marvel, evidence enough that movies are magical, as it sweeps us into the beautiful, terrible world we recognise as Hollywood even now. The cast up and down Babylon is amazing and almost eerily in sync with my own tastes. Actors I deeply love, like Taylor Nichols and Ethan Suplee, show up oh-so-briefly as if casting director Francine Maisler had thumbed through my own mental rolodex and said to herself \""ah, here's another face Sonny would like to see.\"" This is, perhaps, another reason I found myself drawn in by Babylon's excess: I just liked spending time with almost everyone up on that big, beautiful screen, I fell in love with the cast and the story. Believing Babylon to be over, thus missing the last few of its 189 minutes. This was itself a fitting, almost serendipitous, way to end the movie.

It seemed to be a unique spectacle of excess and debauchery in 1920s Hollywood that would combine flashiness with, hopefully and given Chazelle's previous track record, a compelling story and profound character development. Tragically, however, \""Babylon\"" is a bloated misfire that ends up being unique for all the wrong reasons.\n\nRight off the bat, Chazelle brings the viewer along for a ride that ends up being a fusillade of pulse-pounding jazz music, a whirlwind of hedonism, and increasingly sophomoric and eye-rolling moments. This would have all been fine if he had a more coherent story or contextual justification for his indulgence, but alas, he doesn't. After all, some exceptionally well-directed films such as Scorsese's \""Goodfellas\"" (or even \""The Wolf of Wall Street\"") or Paul Thomas Anderson's \""Boogie Nights\"" completely wrap themselves around a crackerjack, virtuoso sense of intensity while simultaneously complementing their own narratives. Unfortunately, \""Babylon\"" does not do the same. The debauchery starts to get increasingly tiring after a while when the characters doing it are thinly written (especially by Chazelle standards) and uninteresting, in contrast to better films about excess that keep the viewer wholly engaged over a long runtime. The film's plot is pretty loose and unengaging for a gargantuan 189-minute runtime, which does not help matters much either. The performances are fine but unexceptional, yet even the more talented actors in the cast can't elevate the disappointing and sometimes-pointless screenwriting they've been given to work with. The result is a movie that feels far less satisfying and impactful than it should have, especially since its many moving parts don't really add up to anything. Even the film's message about the \""magic of cinema\"" comes off as a bit hollow given that many far better films have dealt with that topic.\n\nI hope Chazelle's next film will be stronger than this one, and something I will be eagerly awaiting. Given some of his previous works, he is certainly and clearly qualified of making great films.

The film also follows several other characters at the same party, including movie star Jack Conrad, cabaret performer Fay Zhu, tabloid journalist Elinor St. John, and musician Sidney Palmer, as each rise and fall in their respective careers spanning the end of silent films and the beginning of sound productions; each of the characters cross paths throughout as they navigate the shifting business of Hollywood.\n\nThis large-scale epic from Damien Chazelle is, in a word, ambitious, both in scope and mere technicality. It opens with an utterly ravishing, debaucherous party sequence that captures the maddening spirit of roaring twenties Hollywood, setting a visual bar that is fairly high. While there are a number of fantastic sequences throughout the film, this key party sequence where each of the characters are introduced/first intervene is, without a doubt, the highlight of the film. While its characters are fictional, the screenplay blends them in with passing names of real-life historical Hollywood figures, as well as thinly-veiled references to others.\n\nFirstly, it almost goes without saying that \""Babylon\"" is gorgeously photographed. The performances are also uniformly solid. Diego Calva is a likable presence as the centerpiece character, while Margot Robbie's portrayal of the brash and troubled Jersey girl flying by the seat of her pants is comical and poignant by turns. Brad Pitt fittingly plays the drunken but goodhearted movie star, and Jean Smart is also a welcome presence as the curt and astute gossip columnist, ostensibly based on Louella Parsons (or a writer of her ilk).\n\nThe film is consciously over the top, at many points capturing the madcap spirit of something the late Ken Russell would have directed. Its first three quarters are particularly outstanding, and demonstrate the realities (and technicalities) of how the transition from silent films to motion picture talkies posed legitimate, career-altering (or more often, career-destroying) challenges for nearly everyone who was part of the business. Chazelle projects this theme to the audience in one memorable and protracted sequence in which Robbie's character (along with the sound man) struggles, fails, is interrupted, and struggles again to perform a simple one-page scene. The nuts and bolts of these logistical challenges in a then-fledgling industry are perhaps the most intriguing components of the story, highlighting just how vastly different (and more arduous) the process was of making a sound picture for the actors and filmmakers accustomed to the established ways.\n\nBy the time it reaches its final act, however, the viewer does get the sense that the project is beginning to implode under its own weight to some degree; the focus on certain characters ebbs and flows, and the film begins to lose some steam. It is revived somewhat by an insane sequence in which Torres and another crew member of his film studio (in an attempt to save LaRoy from reckless gambling decisions) cross paths with an eccentric crime boss played by Tobey Maguire, and journey into a subterranean gathering place for the city's debaucherous denizens, who have literally gone underground following the more reserved moral code of the 1930s. The garish and ghoulish sequence feels like a tour of Dante's Inferno (probably quite intentionally), and is almost more madcap than the opening party sequence.\n\nThe film grinds to a somewhat abrupt halt as each of the characters' lives and careers face further significant devastation in the last thirty minutes, and the sense of tragedy that one might expect to feel is strangely absent, perhaps because these characters are in and of themselves larger than life, even cartoonish at times; still, I felt that there was an emotional core missing as their stories are resolved. The film ends on a profoundly cynical note, showing Hollywood as a place that metaphorically devours its own, only to be constantly replenished by the unending stream of those who make pilgrimage there, seeking to etch their mark in the tapestry of cinema. The observation is astute, and the implications are splashed across the screen in a century-spanning montage of snippets from the earliest films to contemporary ones.\n\nAll in all, \""Babylon\"" has many strong points: Mainly its visuals, sturdy performances, and focus on the industrial realities of early filmmaking that most 21st-century viewers would take for granted. It eventually grows a bit long in the tooth into its third hour, and loses some tenacity, but not enough so that the film entirely collapses in on itself (though it comes close).

It's been almost a decade now that Bollywood filmmakers have been trying something out of the box and touching on taboo subjects. Ayushmann Khurrana is doing great there, but let's not forget others. Kindly remember that Rajkummar Rao is there too. His \""Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga\"" with Anil Kapoor and Sonam Kapoor broke the silence on lesbian girls' issues, and his gay-driven \""Aligarh\"" starring Manoj Bajpayee left us stunned. \""Lavender Marriage\"" is one such theme that hasn't been attempted before, and now Rajkummar Rao is here to take that responsibility. While most of the taboo-breaking films, actually all the films, end with the acceptance of identity, Badhaai Do begins with it and then goes far ahead. The concept helps a lot because you are not trying to hide the secret from the audience; rather, you get to know it early, right at the beginning, and then start riding with it until you accept the reality. All of the previous films ended with either a marriage or the acceptance of LGBT people, but did any of them ever attempt to show what happens next?\n\nLet's just say a bisexual couple gets married. What about life after marriage? What about their parenthood, which isn't possible for them? No film ever attempted these things, and that's where Badhaai Do scores high marks. The film is about Shardul, a cop and a gay man, who marries a lesbian girl, Suman. They don't reveal their sexual identity to their families and continue living as a decorated couple while they continue their own sexual affairs with their partners. So naturally, after a year or so, the family members start pushing them towards parenthood, and then chaos ensues. The screenplay for Badhaai Ho needed a lot of trimming. The entire thing moves slowly, dumping you into boredom most of the time. Even the comedy isn't as hilarious as you expected it to be. I don't know why, but Rajkummar Rao has made his image in the comedy genre too, so you ask more of him, but humanly, it's not possible every time. Badhaai Do falls into such a genre where even making a fine comedy is a difficult job-ultimately hurting the massy humour. One thing is certain: it's not a film that the masses can enjoy and understand. These topics are still taboo and can't be watched by the family audience. Moreover, it's coming on Valentine's weekend, making it more appealing to couples. Those who belong to the LGBT community can cherish this Valentine's Day special experience forever.\n\nTo incorporate the additional metaphor into the character, we see Rajkummar Rao playing a macho guy who has sexy physics. The same thing that Ayushmann Khurrana did in Chandigarh Kare Aashiqui because to break the taboos, you need special characters so that more people can relate to it. Honestly, Rajkummar is losing his grip. The same guy who gave outstanding performances in Shahid, CityLights, Trapped, and Newton to raise his bar higher than what we expected is now reducing his own greatness. He looks damn sexy, I must say, and even though the performance is decent, it's not up to his own high standards. On the other hand, Bhumi gets into a challenging zone again after \""Saand Ki Aankh.\"" She plays a lesbian girl with conviction and doesn't shy away from the uncompromised characteristics of the role. In the supporting roles, Seema Pahwa and Sheeba Chaddha are fabulous. They leave an impact despite the less screen space and have got a couple of hysterically funny scenes. Chum Darang's accent sounds terrible, but her performance recovers the loss. Loveleen Mishra and Nitesh Pandey make sure you enjoy every gag when they are on screen.\n\nBadhaai Do has too many songs, unnecessarily. The album by Amit Trivedi, Tanishk Bagchi, Ankit Tiwari, and Khamosh Singh has a lot of content for couples, but the normal audience is looking for something else. Nevertheless, for a one-time viewing, it's okay. The dialogues have some humour attached to them, but they don't generate any organic laughs. Harshavardhan Kulkarni's direction in Hunterrr was fascinating because he used all the realistic theories to describe his characters, whereas in Badhaai Do, he uses nothing but multiple cliches. He's not at great fault because we have been through almost everything that can be brought by taboo-breaking films. Now, it's just a matter of humour and storytelling. Otherwise, you are smart enough to predict the story. Overall, Badhaai Do is a gutsy attempt that tries to shatter all the insights of problems faced by the LGBT community, from hiding their own identity to marriage to never-told-before parenthood, but is hurt by its slow pace.\n\nRATING - 5/10*"", ""Upvotes"": ""40"", ""Downvotes"": ""68"", ""Reviewer"": ""SAMTHEBESTEST""}, {""Title"": ""Homophobes messed with the ratings"", ""Rating"": ""10"", ""Review Content"": ""The movie is REALLY GOOD and is totally worth your time.

Thus, I do not want to spoil anything either, which makes this an incredibly hard review to write! So, what I will do is attempt to explain the basic premise of \""Barbarian,\"" and what makes it one of the most thrilling theatre experiences I've had in a long time.\n\nStarring the beautiful Georgina Campbell as a lone Airbnb renter who is staying overnight at a house in Detroit, Michigan, \""Barbarian\"" opens with Georgina's character, Tess, arriving at her rental to find that another man - played by Bill Skarsgård - is already occupying the home. Claiming that this incident is the result of a simple mixup of double booking, Bill's character Keith invites Tess in to stay the night, promising that, in the morning, they will both get this situation sorted out. From that point on, the movie becomes a razor sharp thriller that will infect audiences with its inherent uneasiness.\n\nIs Keith truly a stranger caught up in an innocent mistake, or is he someone, or something, more nefarious? And is the rental property all it seems to be, or is there a greater mystery to be uncovered beneath its welcoming surface? \""Barbarian\"" begins by introducing question after question to its audience, ensuring that viewers remain on the edge of their seat trying to predict what will next occur. Second after second and minute after minute, this movie is full of surprises, to the point where, after the 45 minute mark, my expectations were blown out of the water to the point where it felt useless trying to guess what would happen next, because I hadn't the slightest idea what could possibly happen next. And that is the highest compliment I can give this movie because, regardless of how you choose to describe this movie, you cannot claim it to be predictable. And on a side note, the fact that the characters actually made intelligent decisions and thought things out only made the viewing experience more tense, because, since everyone was already doing what I assumed a smart person would do, I had no idea how the scenes and sequences would progress. And I also want to pay my compliments to the soundtrack, the direction, and the cinematography, all of which combined perfectly to create a truly chilling experience.\n\nI feel like this is a vague and poorly written review, but only because I do not want to spoil anything for anyone. You may have seen the teasers claiming that this film is so scary that people are screaming, vomiting, and passing out in the theatre - while that is just false marketing at its finest, I will say that \""Barbarian\"" did induce a physical reaction from me at parts - I could feel my heart practically beating out of my chest during certain sequences due to the suspense. So, while I don't necessarily find this film to be scary, it is one of the most adrenaline pumping experiences I have had in a long, long time. If you are at all a fan of thrillers, I'd recommend seeing this on the biggest screen you can find, and preferably late at night.

I was really intrigued by the family dynamic, the daughters, the nature of grief, this doctor who's essentially someone that's composed and tries not to panic, found himself doing just that,"" Elba tells Complex about the survival thriller directed by Baltasar Kormákur.

It's staggering the amount of times a character does the worst possible thing. Don't get me started on the forced family drama. It made me want the lion to eat them.\n\nBut the parts that annoyed me the most have to do with the lion. The people who made this movie either did zero research on lions, or didn't care and assumed the audience is stupid. They hope you don't know that cats can see in the dark. Or that cats can smell their prey. Or that cats have a keen sense of hearing.\n\n(Infomercial voice) And that's not all! This lion can almost fit its entire head under a car, but doesn't use his arm to reach. Cats can reach at least half the length of their body with their arm. Also, this lion has a thousand chances for killshots and decides not to take them.\n\nThis is turning into a rant, but I can't help it. Cats are lethal predators. Even little house cats HUNT AND DESTROY without mercy. This lion has to be the worst lion in the history of lions. Apparently this lion's weakness is small knives. Ugh. That would be like fighting a linebacker with a needle.\n\nWhy not take advantage of the R-rating? This is the perfect kind of movie to go extra bloody and violent. But it's so tame. Why did they CG the humans in scenes with CG lions? It's very noticeable. Why is this listed as horror? It's not scary.\n\nIn conclusion... terrible movie.

Beauty Pooja Hegde and Beast Vijay wasted in a cheap copy of Die Hard."", ""Rating"": ""3"", ""Review Content"": ""Beast (2022) : Movie Review -\n\nNelson's last film, \""Doctor\"", was truly a new attempt in the action-comedy genre for the Tamil audience. Yes, it had those avoidable spoofs that were planted to please the hardcore masses, which disturbed the seriousness of the storyline, but otherwise, it made for a good watchable flick. With Beast, he goes completely massy with superstar Vijay, only to spoil the basic, simple rules of filmmaking. On the other hand, Vijay is also coming from an average flick, \""Master\"", but it was saved by the director Lokesh Kanagaraj. Beast gives him a full-scale, massy avatar but not style and logic. If you remember watching Bruce Willis starrer \""Die Hard\"" (1988), or the recent Hindi adaptation of it, \""Sanak\"" (2021), then I don't think the story of Beast has anything new for you, except the action and hardcore patriotism. Just imagine those two films with regional comedy flavours, and the closest possible outcome is Beast.\n\nThe film is about a talented and patriotic RAW agent, Veer Raghavan, who quits his job after one sad and unwanted incident. Even after quitting RAW, the trauma stays with him as he tries to cure it with the help of a psychiatrist. With the help of his girlfriend, Preeti (Pooja Hegde), he gets a job in a company and visits a shopping mall, which eventually gets hijacked by terrorists. Veer decides to save the hostages for the sake of mental peace, which has got something to do with that old trauma. What challenges he has to face during the battle and how he handles terrorists and politicians to complete the mission is all that forms the rest of the narrative.\n\nThe screenplay here is very problematic. You have no clue about the number of terrorists in there, as Veer finishes them off easily and yet has many more left. Veer's strategies are sometimes successful, while others fail, but he has counter-strategies for every terrorist move. There are a lot of surprises in store, and some are really interesting, but I just can't spoil them here. What brings Beast down is the poor writing and illogical screenplay. The film is hampered by unnecessary comedy because it ruins the importance of a damn serious event like the hijack. You can't have any explanation for hostages having fun and cracking jokes during the hijack. The romance and jealousy parts were too cheesy to accept. Come on, you are the hostages under the attack of dangerous terrorists, so please show some little amount of fear.\n\nVeer Raghavan is a tailor-made role for Thalapathy Vijay. He has his swag, that style that makes his fans go crazy, and a larger-than-life stature in the film. Pooja Hegde has good screen space, thankfully, and she plays a pretty enjoyable role here. There is very little scope for Pooja and Vijay's chemistry because the entire theme happens in a survival mode, but they have a start and a fantastic song together. Yogi Babu does what he does best: comedy! Beast gives every supporting cast member a fair amount of screen time. Selvaraghavan, Redin Kingsley, Bjorn Surrao, Aparna Das, Shaji Chen, Shine Tom Chacko and Ankur Ajit Vikal all appear at intervals throughout the film.\n\nAnirudh has delivered another foot-tapping chartbuster with 'Arabic Kuthu'. The full video song is nothing short of a musical and dance treat for Vijay and Pooja Hegde fans. What dance moves does Vijay have, man. Killer! And how gorgeous Pooja Hedge looks in that ethenic look. Just wait for the full video song to be released, and you will go Gaga over it. But we have that energetic background score here to make you groove to it. The dialogues could've been better considering the swag of Vijay he had in Thupakki, Mersal, Sarkar and Master. I mean, this man is the darling of the masses, so he deserves better dialogues that can create mass hysteria in auditoriums. However, the action is pleasant. No matter how sordid the pre-action conditions are, the stylish action sequences are a sight for sore eyes.\n\nAfter the poor writing, if any person is to be blamed, then it has to be director Nelson Dilipkumar. That awkward vision to carry forward a mediocre storyline is no less than a big mistake. Nelson makes mistakes, repetitively, and that's what hurts the film the most. Those errors in illogical situations can be forgiven, but not the logical confirmation of the director. Why are those comedy scenes needed when you are supposed to make an action thriller, that too with a concept of hijack? It was fine with Doctor because the protagonist was fighting the battle alone, rather than with a crowd of hundreds of people surrounding him. Nelson could have removed the cringe plotting here and Beast could have easily made it a watchable affair. Sadly, that doesn't happen, and the film succumbs to its outdated storyline and lukewarm presentation. Overall, the beauty of Pooja Hegd and the Beast mode of Vijay may please some of their fans, but not others. It's torture for them.\n\nRATING - 3/10*"", ""Upvotes"": ""127"", ""Downvotes"": ""46"", ""Reviewer"": ""SAMTHEBESTEST""}, {""Title"": ""Only for vijay fans in TN, not for everyone."", ""Rating"": ""1"", ""Review Content"": ""If you are hard-core vijay fan then its OK otherwise skip this movie.

Director Nelson Dilipkumar is known for his dead-pan humour and dark comedy. When Thalapathy Vijay announced his next film with Nelson, expectations skyrocketed. And they did live up to it. Beast is an action thriller with mass moments aplenty.\n\nThe film opens somewhere near Kashmir where Veeraraghavan (Thalapathy Vijay), a RAW officer has been prepping for a mission for three months. At the last minute, the Indian government decides to call off the mission, but Veera decides to go ahead as per the original plan, against the orders of his own bosses. He manages to successfully execute the mission, but the outcome leaves him psychologically scarred, forcing him to quit service and return home for good. A few months later, he finds himself in the midst of a hostage situation. He is trapped in a mall with his girlfriend as terrorists demand their leader (who was originally captured by Veera) to be released.\n\nThalapathy Vijay is the sole and the only attraction, as he carries the entire film on his shoulders with his swag and screen presence. He looks stylish and is neat in all the action sequences. Pooja Hegde does not have much to do in the film but looks good opposite Vijay. The comedy created in tense situations works to an extent in a few scenes of the first half.\n\nAnirudh's music is another backbone of the film apart from Thalapathy and Nelson's humour. With a thumping background score, Anirudh once again proves why he is one of the leading composers today. His background score amplifies the stunt sequences to another level, and this is one of those rare films where the music, cinematography and editing gels so well. Kudos to Manoj Paramahamsa and Nirmal for that. The stunt sequences by Anbarivu are stylish, crisp, slick, and innovative. Even though they are slightly logic defying, the conceptualization and execution makes the end result much better than what it should have been.\n\nOverall, Beast has cemented Vijay's place as one of the industry's top stars, it has ensured Nelson Dilipkumar's name as a bankable director who has also created his own signature.

They Desperately Need Stree Back!"", ""Rating"": ""5"", ""Review Content"": ""Bhediya (2022) : Movie Review -\n\n8 decades after George Waggner's iconic werewolf film, \""The Wolf Man\"" (1941), Amar Kaushik takes up the same subject for a social message set in the forests of Arunachal Pradesh. Varun Dhawan gets into the shoes of Lon Chaney Jr.'s memorable character of a werewolf, while Kriti Sanon is not what the other ladies played in that film. Kaushik's horror universe started on a solid note with \""Stree\"" (2018), but then the humdrum attempt by Hardik Mehta, \""Roohi\"" (2021), brought black clouds of tension over the emerging cinematic universe. I really thought that Amar Kaushik was the only person who could have brought the horror universe back on track, but it seems that I was putting up a lot of expectations on him. Bhediya tries too hard to become Stree (with a creature instead of a ghost), but surrenders to its inorganic humour and repetitive conflicts.\n\nBhediya tells the story of Bhaskar (Varun Dhawan), who goes to Arunachal Pradesh to acquire a land set in the jungle. Bhaskar gets bitten by a wolf at a very special yet magical night that happens once a year in a special place (don't ask where, if you have seen it in the trailer). The Bhediya's bite makes him stronger, and he senses the characteristics of the wolf, therefore turning into a werewolf at full moon nights. His friends and Dr. Anika (Kriti Sanon) try to find a way to turn him back into a human. Bhaskar and his friends meet a gypsy (yes yes, the same kind of gypsy sorcerer Maria Ouspenskaya played in The Wolf Man), who gives them a brainstorming but funny idea as an antidote. Will Bhaskar succeed, or will there be any more surprises in store for him?\n\nBhediya is the same story of the werewolf bundled into socialism's package. It's not that it is a copy of The Wolf Man or a remake; we have that tale from an ancient period in our books; it's just that George Waggner's film was the first cinematic adaptation of the legendary horror tale. What Niren Bhatt has done with Bhediya is that he has Indianized the story with comic surroundings and funny characters, a boring romance, and banal cultural lectures, and the mix is somewhat messy. Unlike Stree, Bhediya is barely funny. A lot of drags and flaws in the screenplay make you lose grip over the narrative, and then you start finding diversion by checking out 3D glasses, rearranging them, and cleaning them. A flawless screenplay like Stree comes once in a decade, and as we have seen horror comedies like Roohi, Bhoot Police, Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2, and Phone Bhoot fail to match it, we might have to wait until 2028. Or will Stree 2 make a surprise entry before the scheduled time?\n\nVarun Dhawan transforms into Bhediya, and all those scenes give you chills. However, the comic timing and rest of the appearance remain average. He just seemed like a miscast or miswritten character for a moment. Post Mimi, everyone started taking Kriti Sanon seriously. Even though she had roles like Hum Do Hamare Do and Bachcchan Paandey, we still believed that she could get back to Mimi's Zone anytime she wanted if the script allowed. Well, Bhediya is not that script. Actually, it doesn't even provide her with regular screen time. That's so unfortunate, even if she had a big surprise in store for the fans. There are only two guys who look, sound, and behave funny in the film, and they are Abhishek Bannerjee and Deepak Dobriyal. The rest of the cast hardly appears to be performing, so let's not discuss the names here.\n\nTalking about 3D effects, Bhediya jumps high. The film is designed for 3D viewing, and the scenes are shot keeping that in mind. The visual effects are good, especially the werewolf transformation scenes (yeah, they might remind you of Rahul Roy's Junoon). The background score and music work in parts. Jungle Mein Kaand is a time-pass number; Baaki Sab Theek is a friendly rap number; and Apna Bana Le is melodious but comes at the wrong time. Jishnu Bhattacharjee's cinematography will show you the beautiful nature from the top view, side view, and even the night view. Amar Kaushik as a director has got a step lower than Stree and Bala. Come on, man, this was not expected from you. We hardly have one or two promising directors from the younger generation in Bollywood, and when one of them is doing faith-breaking work like this, it definitely hurts the movie buff in me.\n\nBhediya could have been cleaner and sharper, but Kaushik does unnecessary and unwanted stuff to bring it down. That organic humor, like Stree and Bala, is badly missing. Don't see any reasons why someone like Amar Kaushik would need the kind of \""below the belt\"" humour and cheap jokes we see in Sajid Khan or Farhad Samji movies. Bhediya couldn't hunt that myth of Bollywood filmmakers and, hence, remains at an average height. This one was expected to reach the top of the roof but jumped down somewhere close to the side windows. Watch it for some laughs and a few visually amazing scenes. Dinesh Vijan's horror universe seems to be in trouble again.

People die in this movie. My mouth dropped at Black Adam's kill count. As the numbers increased, the movie set itself in a tonal sweet spot that Marvel won't go near and Sony hasn't quite achieved with its Spider-Man villain films. What Black Adam does is downright wrong, but it's entertaining as heck to watch it play out.\n\nThe current culture has become so comic book literate where the story can just introduce a superhero team, the Justice Society of America, without any introduction. You get to know this team in the midst of the action, wondering about their origin stories or how they got their powers. It works, despite being overly stuffed.\n\nPierce Brosnan as Doctor Fate is quite the scene-stealer, providing gravitas that grounds the conflict at hand and adds another level of seriousness. He's a fascinating character. I hope for a Doctor Fate solo movie with Pierce Brosnan.\n\nAldis Hodge's Hawkman is a great straight man to Dwayne's Black Adam. The heart of the movie comes from the moral argument between them. One character wholeheartedly believes in killing and the other is completely opposed to it. To quote the Dark Knight, this battle of wills is an unstoppable force meeting an unmovable object.\n\nIn essence, Hawkman sets up for Dwayne Johnson to be Black Adam. The character doesn't want to back one step from his principles and just doesn't give a rats.

I would see that the young JSA members were cast to appeal to the teen demographic and a boy was placed at the center of the story to appeal to children, and the fact that the same boy does a voice-over in the opening credits is odd.

The film does feel like a rechristening of the DC universe in a soft reboot type way. Now, the plan seems to be moving away from the Walter Hamada era. It always seemed weird to me how Hamada diverted from Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman stories and just focused on side characters and Elseworld projects.\n\nI am glad plans are being made to get the DCEU going again.

Obviously, with the tragic passing of Chadwick Boseman, that just wasn't possible anymore. I figured they would recast the character and continue forward, but they made the tough decision to write the death of the character into the film as well. For that reason, I was worried and relieved all at the same time. It seemed like an impossible task to make a sequel to such a beloved film, but not have the core character there the entire time. Well, after seeing Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, I can confidently say that they handled it as well as they possibly could have. I thought this film was emotional and fantastic, and here's why.\n\nPicking up six years after the events of Black Panther (in accordance to the events of Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame), this film focuses heavily on the loss of T'Challa and how the country can move forward without their leader. With the emergence of Namor and the underwater city of Talokan threatening all of Wakanda, the remaining characters must band together and protect their country. Shuri (Letitia Wright) is easily the one with the most screentime here and the burden of carrying this franchise is on her shoulders the whole time. This must have been a daunting task, but she pulled it off. Her character, along with her mother, portrayed incredibly well once again by Angela Basset, are the beating hearts of this film. The emotional aspect of this film got me on a few occasions.\n\nSome people may complain about the fact that the death of Chadwick Boseman is basically the jumping-off point for this story to even happen, but I found that it was very tastefully done. With the addition of other characters that will have a future in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, this film was filled to the brim with story. Where I might have my only complaint though, is the fact that this feels like a big budget prelude to what will come next. It's a fantastically made film by director Ryan Coogler and I loved watching every minute of this one, but I have to admit that it did feel like more of a long eulogy for the passing of Boseman.\n\nWith all of that said though, I'm only complaining about that because I'm reviewing it and criticizing it. That complaint isn't something I will regularly say about this film. They take the time to make a great film on top of that, so it really worked for me overall. I can't wait to see where certain storylines continue later and the fact that I'm excited about that, all while this film is satisfying on its own, is nothing short of great. I wept, I was entertained, and I was engaged in the story at hand, so what else could I really have asked for from this film?

It's been a truly inconsistent run of films. There was the good (Shang-Chi, Spider-Man, some of Dr. Strange 2), the eh (other parts of Dr. Strange 2, Black Widow and Eternals), and the ugly (Thor 4, which is easily the worst MCU movie so far). If this movie had been bad, it might have been enough to make me bail on keeping up with the MCU's movies, and truth be told, I've already bailed on the Disney+ series', because WandaVision, Falcon & Winter Soldier, and Loki really didn't do it for me.\n\nIf you're expecting Black Panther 2 to wrap up Phase 4, you might be disappointed. But then again, there hasn't been a consistent narrative to the last two years of Marvel releases, so there's really nothing to conclude, overall. Importantly, it's just a very good movie, and that's enough to ensure it ends Phase 4 on a high. It's not a total slam-dunk, but there's a great deal about Black Panther 2 that's extremely effective, and enough great stuff that I feel the overall movie is a strong one.\n\nI think the pacing is its greatest strength. I really didn't feel the 2 hour 40 minute runtime. The opening half-hour doesn't flow the best, but there was a need to adjust after Chadwick Boseman's passing meant T'Challa died, too. Once the movie establishes this and sets up its main plot, it's pretty smooth-sailing, and unlike many Marvel movies, it saves its most emotional moments and best action scenes for its excellent final hour.\n\nIt's a very emotional movie, and the way it pays respect to Boseman and T'Challa is essentially perfect.

I'm happy to report that Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a success. I think Ryan Coogler and his team hit a home run with Wakanda Forever by paying tribute to Chadwick Boseman and moving the story forward respectfully.\n\nI won't go into spoilers, but the movie starts with an emotional bang. Wakanda Forever builds on the great fondation that was established in the first Black Panther, a visual feast with breathtaking production design, fantastic costumes and impressive action sequences. The music from Ludwig Goransson is once again phenomenal, he creates a signature to this film that gives us the iconic sound of Wakanda while incorporing new themes for this sequel.\n\nSimilar to the first film with Wakanda, there's a lot of world-building with the newly introduced Namor and the underwater world. This allows director Ryan Coogler to let his vision shine on the screen, it's spectacular to look at and the way they filmed the underwater sequences was truly astonishing. Ironically, most of superhero movies depend on their villains in order to succeed, they nailed it with Killmonger and what they did here is just as good, if not better.\n\nI don't think it's a perfect film, with a hefty runtime of 161 minutes, there are some moments that were dragging in the middle for me, but I think it was necessary for this film to be a bit longer than usual. Every character has their shining moments, Shuri is at the heart of this movie but Nakia, Okoye, M'Baku and Queen Ramonda all get their shining moments and a solid story arc that is rewarding by the end, so I don't really have an issue with the movie being this long.\n\nI have some other nitpicks that are spoiler-y, so I cannot really discuss them at the time. Everyone's motivation is clear and the main story is so engaging that I didn't really care for Marvel doing their usual \""laying the ground for the future\"" stuff with certain characters (without getting into details). However, I can say that Namor was a terrific character, I absolutely love what they did with him storywise and visually. He absolutely slays during the action sequences, Tenoch Huerta is a great actor that fits the role perfectly, no surprise with the spot-on Marvel casting there.\n\nThis is a movie to see on the big screen, without a doubt this is the best film the MCU has delivered in the Phase 4. The scale is epic but the film feels very intimate and personal because of what happened with Chadwick. The fact that they incorporated his passing into the story beautifully was so important & crucial.

Instead, I want to focus on a question no one else seems to be asking: what is up with these Wakandans?\n\nI was a definite fan of the first movie, but as the sequel progressed, I found myself more and more annoyed (and irritated) by the film's semi-religious Wakandaphilia. Frankly, the constant self-adulation and smug sense of exceptionalism displayed by every Wakandan character really started to grate. After a while, what I'm sure the film-makers see as a message of empowerment starts to sound a lot like fascistic aggrandizement. If this degree of messianic self-love were displayed by characters in any other (real) country, it would be dismissed as overblown nationalism.\n\nLet's not forget, as the film itself points out, Wakanda is a superpower - possibly the most powerful nation on earth, thanks to its stocks of 'vibranium' - so it's difficult to swallow the idea that they are also somehow persecuted victims. Add to this the fact that they jealously try to preserve their monopoly of this most valuable resource, and its associated technology, and its hard not to see Wakanda as just another arrogant and self-interested power.\n\nIndeed, after a while, my sympathies shifted much more to the rival Talocans, who with some justification came to see Wakanda as more of a threat than an ally.

Two new actresses joined their ranks -- Michaela Coel as Aneka, and Dominique Thorne as Riri, both stepping up in their hero game.\n\nThe new anti-hero Namor is played by charismatic Mexican actor Tenoch Huerta. The film gave him the full backstory dating back to the 16th century, telling the origin of his incredible abilities, and even how he got his name. Even if Namor was the main antagonist of the film, Huerta played him as a passionate protector of his undersea city of Talokan and the Vibranium that sustained it. His comics name Submariner has yet to come up.\n\nDirector Ryan Coogler's production design, costume design and hair and makeup teams outdid themselves in this sequel as they did not only designed Wakanda, but also Talokan. In the comics, Namor's underwater kingdom was called Atlantis, inspired by Greek mythology. However in this new film, Atlantis was given a decidedly Mesoamerican civilzation, from its architecture, costumes, language and culture.\n\nEven though lead actor and original Black Panther Chadwick Boseman had already passed away two years, Marvel made this sequel a beautiful tribute to his memory.

Directed and co-written by Ryan Coogler (\""Fruitvale Station\"", \""Creed\""), it pays an appropriately sombre tribute to its recently deceased lead actor by showing how things can still move forward in the wake of his absence.\n\nOne year after the untimely death of King T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), the African kingdom of Wakanda is still in mourning as they struggle without their beloved monarch to lead them. T'Challa's younger sister, Princess Shuri (Letitia Wright), feels the immense pressure to take over as ruler but believes she cannot handle such a huge responsibility all by herself. Not long after, the inhabitants of the underwater civilisation of Talokan, led by King Namor (Tenoch Huerta), emerge to wage a war against the surface world. With limited time remaining, the citizens of Wakanda must quickly overcome their grief to put a stop to the Talokan threat before everything is destroyed.\n\nAfter the unfortunate passing of \""Black Panther\"" actor Chadwick Boseman in 2020 due to cancer, the MCU was left with a complicated dilemma - should the sequel recast the lead role with a different actor or should they re-write an entirely new story without him? Either of these options would have been a risky move since audiences have become so familiar with Boseman's portrayal of King T'Challa (a.k.a the Black Panther) that it would be near impossible to accept anyone else in the role. It was soon revealed that out of respect for both Boseman and the fans that the latter option was chosen, with the character's in-world demise intended to mirror the actor's real-life death. Now with the release of \""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\"", we see how all of this has managed to play out, in a follow-up that makes good use of its supporting cast while also remaining respectful to the foundations that have already been laid down.\n\nAnybody who saw the 2018 film will remember it has already been established that Wakanda is a place full of interesting characters that have helped this kingdom thrive for so long in seclusion. Because of this, it is believable that its citizens can continue to function without a King due to their personal code of discipline. However, due to their overwhelming admiration for King T'Challa, the Wakandans still feel a sense of emptiness with him no longer being around to lead them and as a result, they are living directionless lives. This is all conveyed to us primarily through the characters that knew T'Challa best and the audience gains a solid understanding of the grief they are each experiencing.\n\nI think the film does a decent job of exploring the concept of losing someone you deeply care about, whether it is a close family member or someone you admired from afar. In particular, we get a good look at how Shuri, the next in line to the throne, just cannot bring herself to take her brother's place as the rightful ruler of Wakanda. Despite her lingering heartache, Shuri, along with the rest of Wakanda's de facto leaders, must find a way to set aside her sadness to confront the looming annihilation by advancing enemy forces. Most of the film shows how not only Shuri, but also Okoye (Danai Gurira) and Ramonda (Angela Bassett) all need to work together in order to prevent a major catastrophe from happening. I interpret this plot element as a metaphor for depression as a whole, since rising above intense emotional pain often requires the help of others. Because of that, this is a nice way of telling the audience that no matter how hard things may seem, there will always be others to aid them through their own personal difficulties.\n\nDue to the prevalent themes of loss and despair, this is the most melancholic film in the entire MCU library, even more so than the beginning of \""Avengers: Endgame\"". Naturally this is a striking departure from the MCU we are all familiar with, which is usually light-hearted and fun for practically everybody. As a result, there are very few moments of comic relief to brighten the mood, and even then it does little to help alleviate the severity of a specific scene. If you are expecting the usual humorous situations that MCU fans have grown accustomed to after all these years or the characters constantly cracking jokes at a convenient time, you are going to be sorely disappointed.\n\nThis film never wavers on its downbeat tone, with frequent reminders that the original hero is dead and not coming back. Of course, this is entirely understandable considering it would be disrespectful to not take into account Chadwick Boseman's monumental contribution to the series and the film plays along like something crucial is missing without him. Bearing that in mind, the film is still enjoyable in other ways. It does contain a number of good action scenes with some creative fight choreography and a deeper exploration of Wakandan lore to keep the audience invested. These are easily the most entertaining aspects of the film, as they remind us that Wakanda is more than simply the location where the Black Panther character originated. Just don't expect to be smiling too much during these highlights.\n\nOut of the three main actors whom the film chooses to focus on, I think Letitia Wright really shone the most as Shuri. Though we have seen Shuri do many important things in previous MCU films, I think it is here where we finally get to see her come into her own. Gone is the confident, meme-quoting sister of King T'Challa and in her place is a mournful, vulnerable young woman who misses her brother and just can't see herself taking his place as leader. Regardless of this shift in personality, Shuri still retains her intelligent side, which is featured much more extensively in this film than we've ever seen before. It's quite impressive to see how well Wright plays into Shuri's insecurities, never once exaggerating her emotions to the point of caricature or melodrama. Instead, she is shown to be a relatable human being, coming to terms with the sudden curveball life has thrown her.\n\nThough I must admit, none of this would have worked as well for Wright without the help of Angela Bassett and Danai Gurira as Ramonda and Okoye, respectively. As previously mentioned, they are all dealing with grief in their own unique ways but soon learn that working together to overcome it as a team is the best strategy. These characters feel like a real family, sticking together through what needs to be done to protect Wakanda from anything that threatens their existence. Even with the King no longer around to assist them, these three still prove themselves a formidable force against any hardship they may face.\n\nGiven the unexpected turn of events surrounding the death of its main star, this film works surprisingly well with its remaining cast members and a more interesting look at Wakanda's place in the MCU. It's hard to say for certain how things may have turned out had Chadwick Boseman lived to reprise his role here, but if I had to guess I would assume we'd have gotten a more optimistic sequel without that feeling of loss hovering over every scene. Personally, I think they made the right decision not to recast and with all of that said, I am nonetheless convinced that Boseman would be pleased to see his legacy honoured in the best way possible under these circumstances. I know I would be.\n\nI rate it 8/10."", ""Upvotes"": ""306"", ""Downvotes"": ""414"", ""Reviewer"": ""MrDHWong""}]"

E., this is a boring movie.\n\nI found myself struggling, and failing, to stay awake while watching this. \""Blacklight\"" is not an action movie - it is a movie where two people at a time (always two people at a time, the movie barely has any sequences where more than two people are talking to each other at the same time - must've been too expensive to film) talk to each other about dull and uninteresting topics. Director Mark Williams seems to not realize what makes dialogue engaging to watch; scene after scene, \""Blacklight\"" depicts people conversing - now some of my favorite movies are full of interesting, tight dialogue. This movie is not.\n\nBut you don't care about the conversations! You're going to see this movie for its purported hard-edged, brutal action! You want to see Liam Neeson get down and dirty and do what he does best! In that case, you should go to your local Best Buy, buy \""Taken,\"" and watch that instead. \""Blacklight\"" does not have much action in it, and when there is action, it's the most mediocre, generic, pedestrian action I've seen since the kung-fu film I made in middle school (shouts out to Albert). One compliment I can give is that the action is edited slightly better than it was in \""Honest Thief.\"" When fists are thrown you can see the hits connect, and the climactic gunfight is mildly exciting, and then inexplicably ruined by a drastic, random change in editing that turns the sequence into a borderline seizure inducing mess - seriously, if you have epilepsy, you're better off leaving the theatre at the start of the third act gunfight, and never returning.\n\nNowadays, going to watch a Liam Neeson movie is like returning home to an abusive spouse - they might end up surprising you with moments of genuine love and tenderness, but more often than not they'll beat you into submission. \""Blacklight\"" beat me into submission. And in fact, I'm considering placing a restraining order on director Mark Williams. Liam's name used to mean something in the wild world of action films. \""The Commuter,\"" \""Run All Night,\"" and \""Non-Stop\"" are three semi-recent Neeson films that are genuinely good, and of high quality. Now, Mr. Neeson is starring in direct to DVD embarrassments that legitimately make sitting at home and staring at the ceiling a more thrilling activity.

Liam Neeson's strong performance, the plot by Nick May and Brandon Reavis and impeccable cinematography all make this film a joy to watch.\n\nThe film follows Travis Block (Liam Neeson), a freelance government operative coming to grips with his past, present (still a bit of a gray area) and future, which he sees in his daughter and granddaughter. When he discovers a plot undermining the safety of American citizens that has proliferated through the upper echelons of national intelligence, Block is pitted against FBI director Gabriel Robinson (Aidan Quinn), whom he once protected while on tour in Vietnam. Using the help of tenacious journalist Mira Jones (Emmy Raver-Lampman) to get the truth out, Block must find a way to keep his daughter and granddaughter safe while combating grave danger.\n\nJust as he plays all of his roles, Neeson seems to have invested all of his mental and emotional energy into perfecting Block's troubled and cerebral personality. He portrays the agent's struggle with great conviction and vigor, and he certainly is my favorite actor in the film. I have to say, though, that as a journalist, I have a soft spot for Emmy Raver-Lampman's character Mira Jones. From Jones' first scene, her grit and tenacity are visible. She even confronts the head of her news corporation! Just as Raver-Lampman acts from her heart, Jones writes from her heart, and I'm sure she would have taken some inspiration from her own craft to portray Jones' courageous quest for the truth. The production of the film isn't all about the acting, though. The variety of unique, dramatic shots in the film including several cutaways, medium shots and closeups, adds to the intensity of several scenes. As is apt for a film with \""light\"" in the name, the lighting plays a large role in the cinematography; the number of bright scenes steadily decreases over the course of the film as the characters descend to the dark depths of their lives.\n\nBlacklight promotes honesty, valor, persistence and perseverance. There's really no other way to put it. Regardless of how many hurdles Mira Jones faces in her pursuit of the truth, she never backs down. Similarly, Travis Block, however ragged he may look, never throws in the towel in his pursuit of the shadowy figure from his past. There is some violence to look out for and in one scene, a political activist is murdered.\n\nI give Blacklight 4.5 stars out of 5, and recommend it for ages 13 to 18, plus adults.

It's probably going to be what most film news sites or discussion groups focus on for the next week or two, and maybe longer if it ends up earning some nominations for the upcoming awards season.\n\nI don't want to talk about the controversy too much, but it's important to address it briefly. Truthfully, I don't understand most of it. This film is shocking in parts, yes, but not as bad as a lot of the early discussions surrounding it made it sound. Almost none of the scenes that involve sex or nudity are presented in a titillating way, and they're all over quite quickly. There's very little about it that's supposed to be erotic, and I think that's evident by how the camera tends to lock onto Norma Jean's face, to emphasize the pain, discomfort, and trauma she feels during those scenes.\n\nSo is it exploiting that pain, discomfort, and trauma? That seems to be the other big talking point. I didn't think so. I think the film was sympathetic to her, and aimed to showcase how misogynistic the film industry was at the time Norma Jean/Marilyn Monroe was active within it. It's arguably not much better nowadays, but whether these exact things happened to her or not feels somewhat beside the point.

The photography does try hard - it does offer us a sense of intimacy, but the whole thing is presented in such a stylised and un-natural manner that it is frequently difficult to tell whether she is/was a \""real\"" woman. Her marriages are treated in an almost scant manner - and her relationship with JFK is reduced to something rather implausibly one-sided and sordid showing nothing of how their relationship might have come to be. It has no soul, this film.

Adrien Brody and Bobby Cannavale don't really have much chance to add anything as her husbands and the highly speculative relationship between her and Charlie Chaplin Jnr (Xavier Samuel) and his sexually ambiguous partner-in-crime Edward G Robinson Jr (Scoot McNairy) does suggest something of the rather profligate and debauched existence that some lived in Hollywood, but again their characters are also largely undercooked and again, we are largely left to use our own imagination.

It felt almost like Scream, but with a modern spin, and while I can say it's not that, this is an enjoyable film if you know what you're in for. It won't be for everyone though, as this film is loaded with subject matter that will turn certain viewers off. All I will say is that it's worth watching, even if you're not enjoying yourself and I'll explain why. You don't have to rush out and see Bodies Bodies Bodies, but here's why it's worth a watch.\n\nDuring a hurricane, a group of young adults party in their friend's mansion, while doing drugs and drinking a lot of alcohol. Not in their right mind, they decide to play a game that requires the skill of trying to find the killer. Things go very wrong though when one of them actually turns up dead. Trying to figure out who the killer is, this group lets out many bottled-up emotions and continuously backstab each other. This makes for some entertaining scenes of heavy dialogue, but it also works against the film in my opinion. The banter/arguing between characters is nearly half of what this film is, but I get that it was meant to be tongue and cheek. It just didn't quite do it for me all the time. In fact, if it wasn't for the ending, I'm not even sure I'd be talking highly about this film at all.\n\nAbout halfway through the film, I wasn't even sure who to root for, even though I knew which characters the film wanted me to care about the most. The mystery always kept me on the edge of my seat, having no idea who the killer was, but I also wasn't sure I even cared that much. With that said, the way this film wraps up is one of my favourite few minutes of the year. Yes, I loved the ending that much. The issue is though, I don't think the rest of the film was enjoyable enough to say that I loved it overall. I will gladly watch this film over and over again with people who haven't seen it though. This is the type of film that has a reveal that comes out of nowhere and I couldn't get enough of it.\n\nOverall, Bodies Bodies Bodies has some fun dialogue and Halina Reijn's directing work (which I have yet to see, until now) was also very commendable. It's just a fun horror/comedy that's not supposed to be taken as anything more. If it was that from start to finish, I'd barely give this film a pass because I just mildly enjoy myself. Again though, it's all about that ending for me. When the film finished, I thought back through the film and it worked a lot better for me. Some people may not like it as much as I did, but I wanted to stand up and cheer for the writers on this one, Sarah DeLappe crafted one hell of a twist.

His menacing presence is the feature only redeeming quality.\n\nThe narrative is overstretched by a terribly slow pace reinforced by wooden dialogues between lovers that don't have much chemistry to begin with. Timothée Chalamet is clearly miscast as his sweet and soft demeanor don't match with the supposed danger and inner violence of his character.\n\nStar of the show, Taylor Russell is beautiful and haunting. She also carries much of the movie on her frail shoulder. But the underdeveloped family moments and repetitive travel adventures don't help to build much of her personality. So when we get to the core horror aspect of the movie it mostly fails. Most \""gory\"" moments are contrived, shoehorned inside the romance. They are too few, tonally all over the place and end up underwhelming.\n\nAfter the masterful Suspiria, I was really expecting Guadagnino to deliver on the horror front but I think he got sucked away by the gorgeous landscapes and forgot to build up tension or fear. Bones & All ultimately ends up being a tiresome teen romance road trip interrupted by bizarre gory scenes.

I was really excited to see this movie given the controversial and disturbing topic that attempts to combine romance with its horror. I am so frustrated by the fact that I truly believe this could've been \""a win for cinema\"", as a famous critic has stated the movie was. I felt like all the pieces of the puzzle were there, but they didn't make a picture. Like others have said, there were so many plot holes, build-ups that lead to nothing, and cramped scenes with little time to involve yourself in the characters. The connection between Maren and Lee didn't feel believable, nor did it feel like they were given enough screen time to make that happen.\n\nIt felt like the director tried to capture too much in 2 hours and it ended up being a scattered slideshow of artsy scenes with gore and confusion. The 5/10 stars I give is for the acting, mainly on the part of Chalamet and Rylance. My other 5 is lost to the direction, editing, and script of the film.\n\nThe trailer and hype was 10x better than the movie itself, so all you need to watch is that. This could've been a true masterpiece, and I desperately wanted it to be. I found myself trying to be convinced it was good, but ultimately faced the honesty that it fell through.

Why would you decide to make this beautiful and haunting story into such a bore of a film? Way too artsy for it's own good, missing most everything that made the book exciting and fresh, and pulling the punches when it really needed it, this film ends up being a complete dud. I have to give it up to the three leads, they do a good job with the script they were given. Too bad the script they were given is a watered down version of what is a gut wrenching (literally) love story. Also, I must mention, what a waste to cast Chloe Sevigny and give her a role that is utterly beneath her acting ability. She's basically reduced to a very brief cameo for seemingly no reason at all. The films only saving grace is the beautiful cinematography and the acting ability of the lead actors, but it is not enough to save this adaptation. I'm actually surprised considering how well Luca Guadagnino has handled other films with source materials, aka Call Me By Your Name and Suspira. Unfortunately, he just could not pull this one off and the film is as cold as a dead fish in the water. The audience I had to share this movie with felt practically the same way I did. Lots of comments such as \""That was it?\"", \""What was the point of any of that?\"" or, my personal favorite, the couple still sleeping in the chairs next to me when the film ended. Overall, I could not recommend this movie to anyone. It's dull, boring and nothing like the book of the same title. For a film about cannibalism, it pulls way too many punches and doesn't go far enough to really show the characters moral struggle with herself, unlike the book. I bet when the author sees this film, she's going to be not so pleased and possibly insulted that her source material was practically regurgitated in such a way.

It floored & devastated my girlfriend and I, to the point that not only was plentiful crying done during the film, but more crying was done several hours later when discussing the movie and reflecting upon its immensely heavy scenes and themes. I expected to be consuming something rather \""different\"", but could not have imagined the way that this film seamlessly combines its brutal horror and tragic drama - people will say \""this isn't horror\"" but the truth is it's a horror film that also happens to be a fantastic drama, therefore it's what a horror movie would be if people accepted that...horror films can actually be good films, with emotional depth, which never seems to be accepted and rarely occurs in this day and age.\n\nI had no idea Luca Guadagnino had this in him. I'd previously seen Call Me By Your Name and his Suspiria remake and although I enjoyed both to an extent, I thought both felt partially like they meandered for a great fraction of their runtime. CMBYN was kind of boring until the end when it's tragedy took hold and it became beautiful. Suspiria was mostly all boring to me with sporadic moments of creative and atmospheric brilliance throughout. Bones & All was nothing like this for me. Though it starts strong, then is a slow-burner for a bit, it's a consistent build from the title card to its finale, which I found to be increasingly gripping, crushing, and impressive as it went on.\n\nThe performances are thoroughly phenomenal. Mark Rylance gives one of the most terrifying performances I think I've ever seen. This is now probably my favorite Timothee Chalamet role - though he is almost always fantastic, this one really falls perfectly into my wheelhouse and it's incredible the way his charm works so organically amidst such dark elements otherwise - it adds a much needed counterweight and bit of relief amidst the utter bleakness of this film otherwise. This was my first impression of lead actress Taylor Russell and she was wonderful - a gentle, nuanced, and very realistic presence - perfect for channeling this character's complex story of being a victim to her own nature, and basically being forced to wander the earth like an abandoned puppy. Do you have severe abandonment issues? If so, this movie will probably hit you hard! The sadness and loneliness that is channeled through Russell's performance is portrayed masterfully. And, I was happy to see Anna Cobb (lead actress from my other favorite horror film of the year, We're All Going To The World's Fair), in her second legit screen role. And, then you have Chloe Sevigny in perhaps her most terrifying appearance ever???\n\nWithout question, Bones & All is one of the greatest films of 2022. It is a singular masterpiece. I've never seen anything like it. I can't stop thinking about it. It is full of so much heart and pain. Pure viscera! To make a brutally violent movie about being cannibals in 2022 and have it hit so hard in an emotional sense - this feat is great! And, Trent Reznor's somber music score doesn't hurt - I'm specifically keen on the \""I'm With You\"" cues from the score - these are the ones that best capture the overall tone of the film's great amount of beauty that is hiding just under its pile of flesh and blood.\n\nClosing, I guarantee that most people will hate this movie because that always seems to be the general consensus whenever a new movie comes out that actually challenges its viewers thematically and emotionally.

Timothée Chalamet brings instant energy and charisma to Lee and together they have a really palpable chemistry.\n\nMark Rylance only has a few scenes in total but definitely doesn't feel underutilized thanks to a role that plays completely against type in a ridiculously unsettling performance that's kindness only adds to how uncomfortable he is anytime he's present.\n\nLuca Guadagnino's direction is amazing, the film looks absolutely gorgeous with it's cinematography by Arseni Khachaturan and has a real tenderness to it.

With this in mind, it was almost impossible to not see parts of trailers for Bullet Train, whether that was on TV or YouTube advertising etc. The marketing campaign for this film is mental, I have seen it everywhere.\n\nThe trailer makes the movie look like a massive bloated action piece - Think Nonstop meets Train to Busan. However, having watched a couple of YouTube film reviews, I was pleasantly surprised to see it described as not just a brainless action movie, but more of a dialogue-based film with clever writing and fast paced back and forth. One reviewer compared it to Guy Ritchie's Snatch and the classic Pulp Fiction - Two of my favourite and most watched movies. That was enough for me, I was going to give it a try and I booked a couple of tickets for opening day, something that I don't do very often.\n\nLet's start with the Dialogue. If anything, it just tries too hard, far too hard. Most of the jokes didn't land for me and the delivery of the fast-paced dialogue quite often would not hit the mark. I can't quite but my finger on why that is. Is it simply poor writing? Or is it down to the delivery? Or is it simply that a number of my favourite movies are heavy, witty dialogue-based movies and my expectations were so high based on several reviews, that I just felt disappointed by this? Either way, it didn't really work for me.\n\nAs you can imagine, almost all the action scenes involved in this movie were delivered on a train, meaning that the fight scenes needed to be compact and tight. This was delivered better than I expected to be fair and plenty of the action scenes were enjoyable, if not incredibly farfetched.\n\nThe characters were relatively varied but were quite generic and cliché. Brad Pitt is essentially the lead actor and probably the best on show. Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry (Tangerine and Lemon) were the characters which I was most excited to see, they played the east end cockney gangster/hitmen type characters. Unfortunately, they came across as just trying far too hard and the chemistry between them just wasn't as good as I imagine the director and producers thought it would be. The Thomas the Tank Engine metaphor also got repetitive after the 25th time it was mentioned. The rest of the cast are hit and miss, nothing majorly impressive and nothing majorly terrible. There are some strange cameos, and when I say cameos, I mean cameos. They literally get seconds of screen time.\n\nOverall, Bullet Train was entertaining enough as a popcorn flick and was an inoffensive way of turning my brain off for two hours and relaxing. I do feel that it's a slightly wasted opportunity though as I can see what the director was trying to do, but it just felt flat and missed the mark on quite a few occasions.

Knowing little to nothing about the characters at hand besides there small presence in some classic Mickey Mouse cartoons- I still found myself to deeply enjoy this film for what it was, and loved its new take and incredible satire on the animation industry.

Simmons, Keegan Michael KEy, Eric Bana, Tim Robinson, and so many more- not to mention its written and directed by Akiva Schaffer of The Lonely Island- there is just so much to geek out about here. The script can go through some familiar elements at times, and it definitely is inspired by the likes of films like Who Framed Roger Rabbit, but definitely better than other films with that same copycat idea like Cool World or Monkeybone. Besides some basic bland formula structure, I enjoyed the humor of this film deeply- and loved the way they handled the references throughout- especially with Ugly Sonic and the numerous Seth Rogen characters which had me dying every time they were on screen. It also had a surprising amount of heart to it as well, and even made me tear up towards the end there, which I have to say I was not expecting from a film about two talking chipmunks.

By far, Rohit Shetty's Worst Flick Ever."", ""Rating"": ""3"", ""Review Content"": ""Cirkus (2022) : Movie Review -\n\nRohit Shetty's Cirkus has a big cast that includes Ranveer Singh, Pooja Hegde, Jacqueline Fernandez, Varun Sharma, and many other comedy actors that are loved by audiences, but the show doesn't do justice to the names. William Shakespeare made \""The Comedy of Errors\"" in the 16th century and gave the world an immortal formula for crazy entertainment. Bollywood has made \""Ram Aur Shyam,\"" \""Seeta Aur Geeta,\"" \""Judwaa,\"" and countless other films on the same formula of twins. The legendary writer Gulzar made \""Angoor\"" on a very small budget and with a not-so-famous cast compared to others and showed them that good content cannot be bought with money. That vision and storytelling cannot be bought, copied, or remade. You have to have it in yourself. Rohit Shetty, who has the most 100-crore grossers for any Bollywood director, was so busy with money spinners that he didn't pay attention to this thing. Cirkus has lavish sets, a big scale, a huge cast, and a big director, but all that goes to waste because it has a tiny content. From writing, screenwriting, performances, music, and direction, Cirkus is the biggest disappointment of the year that nobody expected.\n\nCirkus is adapted from Angoor but set against a different backdrop. It revolves around a funny doctor's experiment in which two pairs of twin brothers can live separately, with one of them staying with the other. Roy (Ranveer Singh) and Joy (Varun Sharma) are adopted by a rich family in Bengaluru, while the other pair is adopted by a middle-class family and have a circus of their own in Ooty. What happens when one pair of Joy and Roy travel to the town of the other pair is all you get to see in Cirkus. It involves a lot of misunderstandings, relationships, robberies, electric current, and chaos. One of our Roys is married, while the other is about to be married. Naturally, the misunderstanding implicates their love interests too.\n\nJust like the ancient circus, the film Cirkus is damn outdated. Forget Angoor's entire runtime; it does not even match 1/10th of it. Even the last 10 minutes of Charlie Chaplin's cult classic \""Circus\"" (1929) are 10 times funnier than this 138-minute loud show. What Farhad Samji, Sanchit Bedre, and Vidhi Ghodgaonkar have written should be sent to the film library to educate people about how not to write a script. The screenplay is even more dumb. A KG student could easily point out mistakes here. Which doctor can have the patience to wait for years to see what his one experiment has done? Didn't he do anything else for years? Having a film based in an outdated era is fine; many writers and filmmakers do it, but what's the need for using outdated execution? Why can't the character be organic and funny? Making cringe faces, busted organs, and shock-giving moments is not enough to make one laugh. Why do you need to use old songs to make our ears bleed? Cirkus is a flop show there.\n\nTalking about performances, it seems that there was a competition among the cast members to see who would do worse. I respect the comedy legends, and I know how difficult it is to act in this genre. I myself had become a topic of hush-hush in school days when I tried a 2-minute stand-up comedy act. Ranveer Singh had a blast last Christmas with 83, delivering his career-best performance, but 2022 has left two black spots on his emerging, illustrious career. Jayeshbhai Jordaar and now Cirkus: Why Ranveer? Why? How on earth can Gully Boy and 83 be followed by these two duds? Pooja Hegde doesn't even try. Radhe Shyam, Beast, Acharya, and now Cirkus-dear Pooja Hegde, you could do a lot better, or should I say you deserved better. In her first verbal dialogue, Jacqueline Fernandez yells, \""Daddy!\"" Just one word, and you know the game is over. Even the re-recorded accents of Pran, Jeevan, and Prem Chopra would have sounded better than the original sound that Sanjay Mishra generated. Varun Sharma is there, but you have to remind yourself of that so often. Siddarth Jadhav, Murali Sharma, Mukesh Tiwari, and Brajesh Hirjee have done decently despite badly written characters. Johny Lever is completely wasted. I mean, can you believe it? How can someone waste THE JOHNY LEVER, and that too in a comedy film?! The rest of the cast has nothing impressive either, so why waste a couple of lines?\n\nCirkus is a high-scale production with good support from the technical team. Current Laga is the only saving grace in the music album, and wouldn't you love Deepika's wild dance steps? The cinematography is neat, the background score keeps you busy, and the locations and sets are eye-pleasing, though some of them look fake and banal. The VFX work didn't provide details on the final output. Cirkus' dialogues might just go down in history books as one of the worst written dialogues for a Rohit Shetty film. \""Main wafadaar hu, Maine aapka Kela khaya hai,\"" \""Itte-cock se hua,\"" and \""Municipality\"" will annoy you. How can Rohit expect us to hear these double-meaning jokes with our families in cinemas? Where are those clean family films by him? Every single laugh is forceful and inessential. What's wrong with Rohit that he got to this level? I never expected this. Yes, I know he's not making those high-repeat value films like \""Golmaal: Fun Unlimited\"" and \""Singham\"" nowadays, but he was doing fine with those decent entertainments that can be least watched at once. I agree, Bollywood has gone wrong in 2022 and has not made good comedies for over a decade, but nobody expected this kind of fall. Cirkus is a king-sized disheartenment. Who'd expected the last Bollywood release of the year to be so bad and tortuous? At least, not me. The pandemic has affected our lives, and so have filmmakers too. It is clearly visible from the products they have made post pandemic. I hope he roars back with Singham and Golmaal Again.\n\nRATING - 3/10*"", ""Upvotes"": ""70"", ""Downvotes"": ""6"", ""Reviewer"": ""SAMTHEBESTEST""}, {""Title"": ""intricate and intriguing plot, and totally hilarious :)"", ""Rating"": ""10"", ""Review Content"": ""This is bar none the most intelligently hilarious film I've ever seen in recent years.

Anderson had read the script but chose not to be involved; Smith canceled the project and made Jay and Silent Bob Reboot (2019) instead. Two weeks before Jay and Silent Bob Reboot was released, however, Smith revealed that he had spent an entire day signing Clerks movie memorabilia together with Anderson and Jason Mewes (Jay). This reunion allowed them to patch things up, and provided him with so much inspiration that he immediately threw away the old script, and started working on a new one with ideas that Anderson was receptive to.

Therefore it's no stretch to assume each Clerks entry is an amalgamation of what Smith himself is feeling or reflecting on in his personal life at the time of creating it.\n\nAnd this time around, with Kevin Smith fresh off of a heart attack in his real life, it's no accident that themes of mortality heavily seep into every pore of this film. And what happens when we're smacked in the face with our own mortality?

Smith's reflection on his own mortality bleed through to the characters flashing back on their lives in the same manner. Smith called this film his \""Jersey version of Cinema Paradiso\"", but I saw it more as his version of Fellini's 8 1/2, especially given that he is literally holding a camera in the film.\n\nThe trilogy is now thematically complete: Clerks 1 embodied youth, part II aging, part III dying.

And that fact is what makes \""Clerks III\"" one of the most unorthodox comedy films in recent years, but also one of the most emotionally satisfying ones.\n\nAdmittedly, I am a huge Kevin Smith fan - admiring him more as a person than as a filmmaker, I think Mr. Smith is a hilarious, humble person whose storytelling techniques make for funny anecdotes and engaging narratives. His question and answer sessions are legendary in terms of their comedic value, and I find myself enjoying the man so much that I can't help but look forward to his movies. And - unlike his abilities to recite the spoken word - his filmmaking skills do seem to be hit or miss. While I have enjoyed a majority of his films, I do recognize that many of them suffer from a lack of focus; relying too much on overindulgent humor and overly drawn out editing that lingers on jokes and scenes so much so that they wear out their welcome, Kevin Smith movies can be diamonds in the rough. Granted, bits of dialogue and drama that border on genius are always sprinkled throughout Smith's films, always elevating his movies, risking making them great if only these sequences weren't in between sequences of crude humor that, no doubt, alienate mainstream audiences. And \""Clerks III\"" is no different, except for the fact that it contains a surprising emotional punch that shows Kevin's newfound maturity.\n\nYes, \""Clerks III\"" has all the juvenile humor your precious heart could ever want, but it's all wrapped around a touching story of friendship and loss that will manage to cut deep into the souls of even the most jaded viewers. My theatre was full of uproarious laughter, but also of sniffles and nose-blowing, demonstrating to me that Kevin finally struck the perfect balance of drama and comedy - making \""Clerks III\"" a dramedy, if you will. But that's exactly what makes this movie so good. Cleverly subverting expectations after giving audiences exactly what they expect, Smith created an emotional and simultaneously laugh out loud film that is sure to crowd please while also forcing viewers to come face to face with their own mortality.\n\nSo, if you're a fan of the previous movies in this series, you'll certainly find a lot of entertainment value from the sharp dialogue and witty gags that Smith has written into this film. While the humor doesn't hit as hard as it did in the first two movies, it still offers enough chuckles and belly laughs to tickle the funny bone of most viewers. The humor is more outrageous than the first film, but more subdued than the second, finding its footing in between stretches of emotional resonance.\n\nWhen watching \""Clerks III\"", you'll be privy to weed humor and potty-mouthed adults, but you'll also witness a very human story about friendship and coming to terms with life. I'm telling you, I didn't expect to practically break down in the theatre, but as tears rolled down my face I began to realize that I was watching Smith's most thoughtful movie since \""Chasing Amy.\"" And it is exactly this thoughtfulness that makes \""Clerks III\"" work on multiple levels; you can walk into the theatre expecting a raunchy comedy, and you'll get it. You can walk into the theatre expecting an adult drama, and you'll get it. By giving audience members what they want in various different ways, this movie is a truly satisfying experience. That works for both Smith and non-Smith fans alike.\n\nThe more I think about this movie, the more I love it. With a wholly satisfying and life affirming ending, \""Clerks III\"" is the drama wrapped in a comedy that I never knew I needed. If you are a Kevin Smith fan in the slightest, you owe it to yourself to watch this movie - and even if you're not a fan of Smith, I'd still recommend this film based on its dramatic merits.

It is a skillfully written and directed by Lukas Dhont, who breaks the films into a classic three part narrative. Each chapter progresses though summer, fall, winter and then spring again and each depicts a new phase of the boys friendship. These changes are told with great effect and provoke emotions in the viewer ranging from joyful satisfaction and warm comfort to betrayed anger and even grief.\n\nClose is set in the seemingly bucolic Belgian country side. And the film-makers take full advantage of the beautiful but labor intensive flower farm our one lead is growing up surrounded by. It is here amidst the farm's blossoming glory we are introduced to the indelible adolescence friendship of Léo and Rémi. For the first third of the film the two are inseparable. Rémi who lives on the same road to town spends his days at the farm and Léo then stays over at Rémi's most nights. Both are not yet burdened with chores of the rural life. So they get to idle away the rest of their last summer before secondary school in play and hi-jinx. Clearly this is how the friendship has been for a long while. And in that moment both would swear nothing could ever divide them.\n\nThe inseparable boys share a closeness that they manifest in a tactile intimacy with each other. This tenderness is nurtured by both families and particular by Rémi's Mother, a maternity ward nurse, who also likes to cuddle warmly with the boys. As an audience we observe the tender support and devotion each offers one and other with natural questioning of their sexuality. We, at the Directors leading, begin to wonder if at least one of the boys feels more than just platonic love for the other. To be clear the film presents almost no spoken homophobia from its many secondary characters to this possibility. The film is clearly set in present day Belgium. So much so even the main sport depicted in the film is hockey. So when at the end of summer the two are still inseparable amongst their new classmates. The fellow students although immature respond mostly with curiosity or disinterest to this possibility. But as the film's setting shifts fully into the classrooms and court yard of a new larger secondary school, some adolescent bullying and unwanted attention increases. The boys begin to question if new personal boundaries are being laid out. Sadly this effects one boy more than the other but both must deal with the consequences.\n\nAs you might imagine for a film like this to succeed the two actors playing Léo and Rémi, need to be thoughtfully cast and very talented. And Eden Dambrine who plays the thoughtful Léo and Gustav De Waele who portrays the talented Rémi do so with skill beyond their years. Their performances are without truly fault. But some might find Léo's cold unemotional response to the third act hardships as disconnected from the warm Léo we've been introduced too. This can be explained by the circumstances. But when the suppressed emotions are final dealt with in a wonderfully written climatic scene, one almost feels the response is just a little off the mark. And this is only notable because you do spend most of the third act waiting for this moment.\n\nClose is well deserving of the critical praise it is receiving at top European festivals. And like the film's plot which moves us from one season to the next it will be interesting to see if the film can find as much praise in an english theater market.\n\nI do want to end on a small spoiler. This film does not end in a feel good moment but rather one that is as harsh and honest as the rest of the third act.

Dialog was briief. Narrative deboned with the fat removed. You get the picture. When the first series of Fletch films was made in 1985, Hollywood cast SNL icon Chevy Chase. He was good in the role.

So if I didn't enjoy the story, if I didn't enjoy the way the movie is shot, and if I didn't even enjoy the acting of everyone in this world who act like complete weirdos, and if I didn't like the weird and confusing dialogue, and I only kinda liked the music and some of the body horror stuff, I can't really give it a high or even a mediocre rating.\n\nFirst of all, the movie doesn't even try to present the plot or the characters in an interesting way. Like the director doesn't even care, which there might be something admirable there, but it doesn't make for a good movie. Like do you remember the movie Passengers from 2016, which had an interesting plot but it was mediocre at best, then someone edited the movie and replaced the order of acts 1 and 2 and it became a whole new movie with mystery, suspense, and tension and it made it so much better? Yeah, this movie feels like that but a hundred times worse.\n\nPresentation really matters. Things just happen in the movie without a single ounce of suspense or tension. We don't know the characters and we don't really get to know their actual motivation and what they're thinking about. There's even a scene like 10 minutes into the movie that reveals something about the protagonist, but it's presented in the blandest and most unsurprising way. Like it's technically a twist, but it doesn't feel like a twist at all. It's like \""oh, so this happened, cool I guess\"". Like they could've shown that in the beginning and it would've made no difference at all.\n\nI don't really know why, but apparently, everyone in the future is super creepy and absolute weirdos. Everyone acts weird like they're not even human, but the weirdest one is the Kristen Stewart. Why does she talk like that? Who knows! Why is she always on the verge of crying? Why does she talk and act like someone had her balls in their hand and was squeezing them and she wants to cry and can't speak loud enough all the time?\n\nWhy is the dialogue so weird, confusing, and meaningless? Why does Viggo Mortensen go around in a ninja suit like he's a vampire or something? \""I get cold\"", ok that's cool, but why is that?\n\nWhy is everyone obsessed with the organs and autopsy? \""Surgery is the new sex\"". Really? Did humans develop a new desire related to maiming that is better than sex and orgasm? How? The movie doesn't even tell us if or how or why they are enjoying it more than sex. They say at the beginning that humans no longer feel pain and infections are gone, so no matter what you do with your body, you won't get a disease or feel any pain at all. But how does that lead to enjoying getting cut and having your internal organs pulled out feel better than sex? Why is everything shown from the life of these people, is just eating weird mushy food and talking about bodies and organs every second of their life? Like are they so obsessed that they have literally nothing else to do?\n\nThe budget is really small, so I get that we're not gonna get Blade Runner 2049 level of world-building and set pieces. But the whole movie is literally in ruins and ship graveyards. I'm not kidding, literally every \""house\"", every \""art gallery\"", and that office is an abandoned house with rundown walls.\n\nI really don't know what the point of the \""twist\"" was, if it wasn't gonna go anywhere. Or the point of those two women, if they don't show, tell, or even hint at who they were and why they did what they did. It just seems like a movie with a couple of ideas that go absolutely nowhere at all.\n\nThe only movie from Cronenberg I've seen, a while back, was eXistenZ, and I absolutely loved it. I enjoyed the twists, I enjoyed the mystery, the suspense, and all the gross body horror stuff, and I was really shocked how well it predicted what video games in the future are gonna look like. Like you could say it was Matrix before Matrix. So I thought Cronenberg was pretty smart and he predicted video games really well in a genius way. But this is nothing like that, the concept is weird and it's presented in the blandest way as if the director didn't care at all, it's not clear what it wants to say or what it is actually about, and it's not a fun watch like eXistenZ.\n\nBut then again, eXistenZ shockingly did really predict how video games were going to be very well, so who knows, maybe we'll look back at this movie in 30 years and we'll be awestruck with how accurate this movie was!"", ""Upvotes"": ""157"", ""Downvotes"": ""105"", ""Reviewer"": ""MamadNobari97""}, {""Title"": ""I honestly don't know how this is rated so highly right now."", ""Rating"": ""1"", ""Review Content"": ""This is the worst movie I have seen in a long time.

Dumped on OTT, just two weeks after Akshay Kumar's last release seems to convey how the expectations from the actor has dropped. The other one is obviously the rushed climax that destroys the movie. The antagonist is reduced to a two-dimensional (rather one) caricature of a character. The backstory is reduced to a 10 second montage (pathetic!).\n\nAkshay Kumar doesn't seem like the right guy for this role. This could have done by a newcomer instead. At least it would have given them a good launchpad. The other actors don't matter here because they don't have to do much. Chandrachur SIngh's presence is welcoming though. His renaissance has been one of the better ones the industry has seen.\n\nCuttputtli is a miserable attempt at remaking a film.

Except for the rhyming metaphorical title, the Hindi remake of Ratsasan has nothing better than the original, nor does it try anything different. Ratsasan has a few low-grade scenes due to budget issues, or maybe it's natural or common for Kollywood films. However, the amount of thrill and suspense is more than any other modern Tamil flick. That indeed works - for Tamil audiences, of course, if not wider. The Hindi dubbed version of Ratsasan has been watched by more than 40 million people on YouTube, and by almost double that number of people through torrents, telegram, and other movie download sites. The viewership amounts to more than the number of people who saw KGF Chapter 1 and KGF Chapter 2 in cinema halls. So the basic question is, was this remake really needed? The audience for the thriller genre is always low, and then there is an OTT release which hardly has clarity in viewership. Who's gonna watch it? Those who haven't seen Ratsasan, right? How many are left, by the way? Anyway, let me clear it for you that Cuttputlli sparks lower than Ratsasan's magical, thrilling show. Does that excite you? The choice is completely yours.\n\nCuttputlli is about aspirant film writer and director Arjan Sethi (Akshay Kumar), who joins the police force after a string of failed filmmaking attempts. As soon as he joins the Kasauli Police Station, a serial killer goes berserk in the town, kidnapping and killing teenage girls brutally. Arjan's senior officer, Sho Parmar (Sargun Mehta), treats his filmy brain low at first, but then realises the mistake after one more brutal murder. Arjan falls in love with a schoolteacher, Divya (Rakul Preet), and continues his search for the mastermind killer. Will he be able to save the other girls? Will his smartness be enough to beat the mastermind? Find out all the answers in Cuttputlli, in case you didn't read the answer sheet already in Ratsasan.\n\nRam Kumar's script is loop-free, be it Ratsasan or Cuttputlli. You can't guess the killer even with that storming brain that has seen more than a hundred classic thrillers. I guess that's the fun here. But can I say the same for the screenplay? The answer is a clear No. What goes wrong is flawless momentum. In the beginning, you waste more than 15 minutes building things up. Then you have a love story running in the thriller (as if that's mandatory for every Indian film), just to link up the characters later. The idea is brilliant, but the backdrop isn't. Nonetheless, this psycho thriller thing has to have some nonsense to keep the dramatic elements alive. Cuttputlli cuts many useless scenes from Ratsasan and gives it a good trim. But it fails to add something of its own. It's just a frame-to-frame copy, with no soul and body of its own. Aseem Arora's screenplay has a few glitches, but overall it's a decent remodelling of Ratsasan.\n\nAkshay Kumar as Arjan Sethi is neither impressive nor dull. There was nothing different to do from what Vishnu Vishal did, and therefore the comparison makes it look dim. Of course, whoever is the first always goes away with more praise, and that's what has happened with Cuttputlli too. Rakul Preet looks gorgeous in every single frame, and the cinematographer has made her look even more beautiful with close-up frames. To be frank, performance wise, there was no scope. Suzane George did look devious in Ratsasan as she had such a face and body, but here Sargun Mehta looks too gorgeous to be devious. Chandrachur Singh, Hrishitaa Bhatt, Gurpreet Ghuggi, and the child artists are decent to good in their supporting roles.\n\nCuttputlli looks like a very low-budget film on screen. The screen filters are bad. Even the prosthetics are visible, from eye brows to powder to every cosmetic. Didn't the editor see it? What was Ranjit Tewari doing in front of the monitor anyway? Julius Packiam's background score with no words and dance is better than Tanishk Bagchi and Dr Zeus's boring songs with lyrics and dance. Cuttputlli is badly edited and shot, just like any low budget thriller from a substandard industry. If they trimmed so many scenes from Ratsasan, why didn't they trim songs? Wasn't it a good chance to show your cinematic intelligence? Cuttputlli sounds better than Ratsasan's Hindi dubbing just because it was the original language, but Hindi-dubbed viewers won't understand this. Those who watch films in the original language with subtitles will understand the difference here. So the question remains, is Cuttputlli better than Ratsasan? Hell No! Is it as good as the original one? The answer is a clear No. Does Cuttputlli offer anything new from the original? The answer is No. Can it be watched? The answer is, it depends. Those who have seen Ratsasan should skip it for good, and those who haven't, can watch it - only to acknowledge why the original was a 'magical show'.\n\nRATING - 5/10*"", ""Upvotes"": ""29"", ""Downvotes"": ""12"", ""Reviewer"": ""SAMTHEBESTEST""}, {""Title"": ""Best moviee"", ""Rating"": ""10"", ""Review Content"": ""Cuttputlli is a dark pycho edge of the seat mystery thriller that would set your heart aflutter with its tortuous criminal investigation filled with emotional ride.

Debutante director Jasmeet K Reen, who has co-written this film along with Parveez Sheikh takes a closer look at patriarchy and domestic violence (DV) amid the social-psychological milieu of the lower middle class.\n\nSet in Mumbai, where the rich and not so privileged co-exist and resilience rides high, two women - mother and daughter, find their own heaven in hell. They find ways to bring their own sunshine even as dark clouds hover around them. They laugh in the face of adversity and make merry with whatever little they have.\n\nEven as Hamza habitually beats up Badru black and blue in a drunken state or driven by uncalled-for rage, she devotedly makes an omelette for him the next morning. He apologises to his 'darlings' and she happily forgives him... the cycle continues. She reminds herself that theirs' is a love marriage after all and these arguments and such abuse must be common across. However, a tragic incident forces her to recalibrate her life decisions and her views on her manipulative husband. Violence begets violence but can revenge set you free ? Who's the real victim here - the one who fights back using questionable methods or the one who normalises abuse in the name of love ?\n\nContrary to the trailer, Darlings isn't quite a dark comedy or a twisted suspenseful thriller. Told in a linear, simplistic fashion, the film is about an abuser exploiting his partner over a man versus woman battle. While the subject at hand and observations are powerful, the storytelling and editing needed some work. Shot in a confined space throughout (a rather spacious chawl room), the film keeps going in circles, making it more of a monotonous drama than a gripping domestic noir. The climax feels morally conflicted and leaves room for thought. The irony of a beauty parlour lady drawing a mehendi on a blushing bride, while being privy to an abusive marriage next door or a handcuffed Hamza being asked to peel veggies by a suddenly hardened wife... and more such nuances are finely captured.\n\nAlia Bhatt once again has proved why she's not hyped just for the sake of it. She plays her part brilliantly as the gullible wife who believes she can change her husband. Despite a stellar performance by Alia, Vijay Varma remained to be the most intriguing element for me in the film. The artist in him owns the hate he gets for Hamza so much that almost starts feeling like he's feasting on the same to improve his character. The emotions he enrages in you from fear to the urge of killing him is a sign of his artistic brilliance & the magic of this script.\n\nShefali Shah flows with the story as smooth as the butter. The emotional burden Rukhsar comes in the guise of her quirky nature is highlighted impeccably well by Shefali ma'am. Post Choked, Roshan Mathew chooses yet another interesting character portraying his skills at the best. The way his character is used for comical relief in the second half stands out. Rajesh Sharma doesn't get much dialogue but still, he adds certain substance to his role.\n\nApart from Prashant Pillai's intriguing background score, it's the sound design of the film that took the cake for me. From the sound of Vijay Varma banging his tiffin on the stairs while climbing up to syncing guitar-riff in a very important 'sandal-hitting' scene, the designer uses all this external noise extremely well to create the tension in the room. Vishal Bhardwaj & Mellow D's songs just land perfectly without creating any obstruction. The rap song Bhasad is to this film exactly what Badla was to Blackmail.\n\nAll said and done, Darlings is Bollywood getting as close as it could ever be (to date) to Andhadhun.

And who doesn't agree? Almost everyone does, I suppose. Well, Dasvi is actually based on a theme which is entirely dedicated to Mandela's thoughts, but fails to provoke those thoughts in good manners. Tushar Jalota's political cum family cum competitive cum educational drama stays out of context most of the time, and when it comes to the point, it's just pointless.\n\nDasvi is about an uneducated politician, Ganga Ram Chaudhary (Abhishek Bachchan), who is jailed under a tough cop, Jyoti Desval (Yami Gautam Dhar). Under the circumstances, he passes his reign to his wife, Bimla Devi (Nimrat Kaur), who soon starts taking over his territory. First as a trick, but then, after being humiliated for his low education (8th standard), he decides to spend his time studying for high school while his scheming wife has plans of her own. The basic idea was to mix the educational theme with dramatic elements, but as it goes ahead, it forgets the main context. When it comes back to its senses, it's too late to recover from a flop show. Not just that, but even the rest of the additional factors like comedy, political conspiracies, muted feminism, equality and self-realisation haven't got anything that can be called perfect. The humour is somewhat pleasant, but only on a few occasions. The same subject could have been handled smartly, with altered conflicts and exaggerated drama. That, however, is too lengthy to make sense and grab your attention. Dasvi isn't about just one exam, but multiple at the same time, and maybe that's why it fails to score passing marks. Even the technical chapters like music, cinematography, editing, and set designing add up to nothing materialistic.\n\nSpeaking of performances, it seems that Dasvi has scored respectable grades here. Abhishek Bachchan as CM Chaudhary is everything. He's smart, dumb, tricky, diplomatic and cunning. I only wish that all those things were balanced in the right order. Nevertheless, Abhishek Bachchan still delivers an honest act which can't be hated. The female lead, Nimrat Kaur, goes through a transformation that isn't easy to digest. From a cowardly home cat to a screwy CM, Nimrat shows different and truer colours of her acting talent. Yami Gautam Dhar plays a tough cop, and She is indeed tough. Quite possibly, this is her most hard-boiled role to date, and she is surprisingly lovable in it.\n\nWhat makes this exam difficult for Dasvi is the director's ordinary vision of a high-scope storyline. Naturally, he can't be blamed for the writers' mistakes, but his storytelling wasn't all that great in the first place. You don't see any reason why those spoofy scenes are scheduled after some really good ones. Was that historical spoof made for KG students or what? And what was the outcome? Even the board members of SSC/CBSE would know no answer to that. Whatever exiguous scenes there are, I mean those studying techniques of Chaudhary sahab and his dialoguebaazi on Indian politics, are indeed enjoyable. Apart from that, there is nothing like a study material for cine viewers. Overall, it's a skippable flick, and it's good that it came on OTT.

Did Branagh think that stretching out the movie with Poirot's back story would make something out of a collection of tics that Agatha Christie used in place of learning how to write a character?

The trademarks of Park's films, which have sometimes seemed to become equivalent with the reputation of South-Korean cinema in general, are shocking violence, the eccentric portrayal of love, and complex narratives that employ surprising twists. The latest film from the director probably will not disappoint the dedicated global audience of such films, but \""Decision to Leave\"" (Heojil kyolshim, 2022) is also something much more.\n\nHae-jun (Park Hae-il) is a married police officer who suffers from insomnia as he keeps driving between two cities on misty roads. His work is in Busan, but his wife (played by Jung Yi-seo) awaits him in Ipo. When a businessman dies in what seems to be a mountain climbing accident, the police immediately pick up the businessman's Chinese wife Seo-rae (Tang Wei) as a primary suspect. The case seems clear to most, but Hae-jun's feelings for Seo-rae cloud his vision and judgment. In typical Park fashion, the situation quickly turns more complicated, Hae-jun's feelings become obsessive, and soon there seems to be no way out from the mist of emotions.\n\nThere is a touch of Masumura's \""A Wife Confesses\"" (1961) and, obviously, Hitchcock's \""Vertigo\"" (1958) in the film's premise, but Park has stated that \""Decision to Leave\"" was in fact inspired by a Korean love song \""Angae\"" (or \""Mist\"") sung by Jung Hoon Hee in the 1960's. In the song, someone, who has lost their lover in the past, gets lost in the fog. We speak of \""brain fog\"" or \""clouding of consciousness\"" when describing the experience of indecisiveness and lack of focus, which are also signs of depression. Hae-jun is not necessarily clinically depressed, though his compassionate if a bit over-caring wife is concerned. After all, Hae-jun, a middle-aged man, belongs to a high-risk group. His wife thinks that Hae-jun needs violence and death in order to be happy, but the cop, who has dedicated a wall in his Busan flat to unsolved cases, does not seem jovial. Hae-jun needs his job or, more specifically, the attempts at solving mysteries to feel a sense of meaning in his life. This is the reason he initially falls for Seo-rae; she would fit perfectly on his wall of unsolved cases. She is a walking enigma.\n\nAlongside Hae-jun, the spectator must constantly guess whether Seo-rae is leading the cop on or not. Some of Seo-rae's behaviours, actions, and decisions may remain a bit unconvincing, which casts a faint shadow of implausibility to the film. On the other hand, the inability to fully grasp the character fits this film like a glove. An additional air of mystery is added to the character for the simple reason that she is Chinese. Since Seo-rae does not speak perfect Korean, she and Hae-jun must occasionally rely on apps on their smart phones for translation. As is well known, of course, things get lost in translation. And the multiple screens between them are not helping. In the end, the spectator is -- just like Hae-jun -- left incapable of having the final verdict on Seo-rae, this ephemeral character in the foggy landscape.\n\nCommunication is thus clouded not just between characters but also the film's narration and the spectator. Both Park's style and narration obfuscate the sense of space and time. The complex plot is told in a fast pace, and narration keeps jumping back-and-forth between scenes, many of which have been executed with unprecedented innovation. For just one example, there is a scene where Park is able to combine Hae-jun in bed with his wife, him staring at mold on the corner of their wall, Seo-rae watching a Korean soap opera, and x-ray images related to the crime. Even if Hae-jun and Seo-rae were in different places in different times, Park constantly cuts their looks together. As a result, there is this continuous impression of a gaze that defies dimensions of space and time in the poetic space of the film. By means of editing, Park creates a luring kaleidoscope of ambivalent emotions. At times, this formal approach might make the following of the story a little challenging for the spectator, but the facts of the story do not in the end seem to matter that much. The atmosphere of Park's neo-noir melodrama is clouded by a brain fog in which it is difficult to concentrate and make decisions.\n\nAlthough \""Decision to Leave\"" treads on familiar terrain for Park, as a film about love and obsession, I must say that I enjoyed it more than any other film from him. Even with his best films, I have always found Park's complicated narratives and his shocking violence somewhat self-deliberate, self-indulgent, and a bit bloated. Here, there are less gimmicks, and the film just feels more earnest, even though it is still a complex story. Given that \""Decision to Leave\"" resembles \""Vertigo\"", some might have presumptions regarding Park's eroticism, which invaded his previous film \""The Handmaiden\"" (Ah-ga-ssi, 2016), but such reservations are unfounded. Curiously, \""Decision to Leave\"" holds back in its portrayal of romance and erotic tension. In the film's most intimate scene, Hae-jun and Seo-rae exchange a bit of lip balm. \""Decision to Leave\"" may not persuade completely, but it is still, to my mind, Park's most intriguing work.

The plot has multitudes of layers to it and is narrated in ways that requires closer inspection and while the technical mastery is top-notch, the film is surprisingly missing the immersive quality of his best works.\n\nThe central romance plays its own tricks amidst all the secrecy & revelations that surface every now n then and a few scenes even manage to stand out but the film's intentions remain shaded despite never losing its intrigue.

Based on his work, arguments can be made on both sides. Director Adrian Lyne is either a staunch believer in monogamous marriages, or he enjoys mocking the concept altogether. Surprisingly, this is his first film in 20 years since UNFAITHFUL (2002). To refresh your memory, he's also the force behind 9 ½ WEEKS (1986), FATAL ATTRACTION (1987), and INDECENT PROPOSAL (1993). Co-writers Zach Helm and Sam Levinson have adapted the script from the 1957 novel by Patricia Highsmith, who also wrote \""The Talented Mr. Ripley\"" and \""Strangers on a Train\"".\n\n\""Do you know I love you?\"" When one spouse feels the need to ask about love rather than declare it, you know it's an unusual marriage. And in the category of unusual marriages, you'd be hard-pressed to find an arrangement more bizarre than the one between Vic (Ben Affleck) and Melinda (Ana de Armas). Thanks to real life public drama for Will Smith and Jada Pinkett, we all know that \""open marriages\"" are a thing. But this with Vic and Melinda is neither fully \""open\"" nor fully a marriage. Vic invented and sold a computer chip used in drones (mostly for warfare) and he's so rich, that he'd rather watch his free-spirited wife drag home new boy-toys than give her an expensive divorce. But that's as much explanation as we receive for what seems like a lose-lose-lose scenario. That third lose is for Melinda's gentlemen friends who seem to mysteriously disappear once Vic becomes aware of them. One is gone before the movie even starts, and he's followed by Jacob Elordi, Brandan Miller, and Finn Wittrock.\n\nPerhaps the biggest mystery here is in deciding who displays more charisma, Affleck in this role or the snails that his character Vic breeds. We've joked about actors sleepwalking through roles before, but there are scenes here where that may actually be happening. Affleck mostly just dead-eyes Melinda and her men, though we are supposed to interpret his lack of expression as a combination of anger, jealousy, and lust. Fortunately, we have Ana de Armas to liven things up. She's a full-grown party girl going through various stages of designer dress and un-dress. The supporting cast is comprised of Dash Mihok, Lil Rey Howery (who is in every movie these days), Kristen Connolly, Grace Jenkins as the smarter-than-parents kid to Vic and Melinda, and Tracy Letts as a curious novelist constantly side-eyeing Vic as research for a new book.\n\nIs it cheesy? Yes. Is it sleazy? Yes. Despite twenty years of no movies, director Lyne delivers another high-gloss, play-pretend trashy erotic thriller that will fit perfectly in the streaming world. Affleck disappoints here after strong turns in THE TENDER BAR (2021) and THE WAY BACK (2020), and Ms. De Armas will next appear as Marilyn Monroe in BLONDE. Ben and Ana had their tabloid moment as a romantic couple after filming, but she is now the gone girl, and he has since reunited with JoLo.

All of the roles have good chemistry and work for the movie.\n\n-Jackson is the character I really wanted to see a little more of. She was a strong woman that was realistic, balanced, and fun serving as an anchor to the military feel.\n\n-Jackson has some of the best moments and dialogue of the movie, and really does a nice job with the time she has on screen for establishing the family dynamic.\n\n-Powell's performance is even more dynamic than his Top Gun days. He plays these pilot roles quite well, keeps the tough guy component in, but somehow makes the character more dynamic.\n\n-Handled the dramatic dialogue super well, but yet conveyed other emotions. By far the most balanced of the actors for the emotional spectrum.\n\n-That ending is a fantastic display of his range of acting -Majors knows how to play strong roles and he continues that streak with this stoic, focused, and determined pilot role.\n\n-And yet, those vulnerable moments show just how much he has the emotion down, which makes for a great variety of qualities to that character. He plays the pilot real, and does not tread down the invincible superhero that these roles tend to be.\n\nThe Music -Symphony scores are the keys to this movie for musical spectacle, worthy of the theater visit.\n\n-Loud instrumental pieces add to the action scenes and give that gallant approach that helps immerse you into the moment and get your adrenaline up.\n\n-Other instrumental works are about capturing the fun times, adding the jazz feel to the party scenes, and the vibrant party tunes for just enjoying life.\n\n-The end moments are that emotional kick you need to appreciate the entire chemistry between everyone, and the inspirational tale that Brown's story is.\n\nThe Better Balance: -Deals with the racism component with class and focus and does not rob the movie of the other qualities.\n\n-Drops that component as part of the story and uses it for fuel to paint the characters in the way they needed to be painted.\n\n-Loved the dialogue with this tale and how they did not let it get away from them and again made it natural.\n\n-By taking this approach, we really got the multiple perspectives down that he might have experienced during his time in the Korean War.

The special effects and setting are the machines used to take us back in time and establish the culture to help get you into the moment. While the acting performances are the emotional sword wielded to help pull the weight of Brown's achievements on you and craft characters you care about and wish to follow. With sound editing and a musical track pulling a fair amount of weight to help pick up the slack. However, this movie does struggle with the rushed pace of the runtime in a movie and that may be the biggest mistake of the movie for me in terms of not reaching the full potential. Characters are not consistently integrated, to the point I did not need to see them, while foreshadowing sort of blunts the surprise of what might happen to our band of pilots. My biggest let down is the action of the movie. While not the worst action scenes in a war movie, the battles aren't as long or as wow factor as other films have done. Pearl Harbor set the stage for those kinds of scenes and adding that movie magic might have saved face. Overall, Devotion might have done better as a mini-series to help give Brown's story more time to shine and explore the comradery of the group.\n\nMy scores are:\n\nAction/Drama/War: 7.0 Movie Overall: 6.5."", ""Upvotes"": ""66"", ""Downvotes"": ""31"", ""Reviewer"": ""rgkarim""}]"

They really did the original movie injustice and I'm surprised they got all of the actors with this script.\n\n-First of all I'm not sure how they managed to make the CGI actually worse. Even the animated parts look worse. Did they spend all the budget on actors and rushed everything else? Enchanted still holds up but this... Bad.\n\n-Why are they breaking into a song every 5 minutes? They should've paid more attention to script and the character development rather than 10 mediocre songs. It's way better to have 3-4 actually good memorable songs than 10 that are meaningless and uninspired.\n\n-It uses already done many times clichés and relies on previous Disney movies. It was literally Rapunzel and Cinderella with a bit of Snow White mixed in. Why not do something new? Why just rely on existing tropes. Little nuances and cheeky call backs are nice here and there but the whole movie was like that. Try a bit to be a little bit original at least.\n\n-The set design looks very fake, costumes look meh.

This movie was less about Strange and more about her.\n\nThere's also a subplot involving Strange's old flame, but since we only saw them as exes in the previous film, it Didn't really feel that impactful.\n\nThere's also an obligatory teen sidekick, which I guess is now standard in the Phase IV fully Disneyized MCU. She might have been interesting, but she's just there as a macguffiin and has no real personality.\n\nThere's also random cameos from other Marvel properties, I'm beginning to see these bits of crossover fan service are the sole purpose of having a multiverse.\n\nSeriously, I don't know why I keep giving my money to this franchise. Black Widow, Eternals, Shang Chi and now Dr Strange 2, have all been dull, uninspired CGI crap fests, that rely entirely on cameos and fan service to keep people coming back. Let's just face it, Hollywood milked all they could from Marvel.

I had the same expectation when I first heard about the name of the movie and saw the trailers. But trust me, the whole thing revolves around the Multiverse And there is a lot of Madness, but not in a way you're thinking of. Naming this movie Multiverse of Madness was a real double-edged sword and it really shows, by how people reacted to it.\n\nFirst of all, I gotta say that this is probably the most different and unique movie of MCU, at least in the aesthetic department, or should I say the most different-looking. And you already know it's exactly because of Sam Raimi and the horror and creepy aspect he introduces in this movie. And I loved it!\n\nAbout the runtime, I remember seeing people argue that 2 hours is not actually bad and Sam Raimi movies are always more or less 2 hours and we are the unreasonable ones to think 2 hours. And I and many others thought \""well how is a movie about the multiverse is gonna be only 2 hours? We need at least 3 hours\"". Which weren't wrong, because after watching the movie I can say that it definitely needed at least 20 more minutes. The pacing is really on and off, it kinda lingers in some scenes and it fast-forwards in some scenes that needed more time, especially the ending. I think they just need to hire better writers because once again, this didn't \""feel\"" a movie, it felt like an episode and a teaser to the real thing, but I still really enjoyed it and had fun with it.\n\nAnd it is really weird too because the last movie they released was literally 2:28 hours and they've already seen that the longer runtime still sells like Infinity War and the 3-hour Endgame which are like in the top 5 of all time sellers in BoxOffice. I don't know why they cut scenes or why they didn't let some scenes linger more. Was it because of the writing? Then why not hire better writers or a team of writers like Markus and McFeely who knew what they were doing and gave us 4 decently written movies? I hope now that they're delving into the multiverse stuff, they actually get more creative writers and work on the script a lot more before releasing the movie.\n\nIt would be interesting to see a director's cut of the movie or even a Scott Derrickson version where he actually continued the first movie and not mainly WandaVision (which is an understandable problem people have with this), but we'll never see just like we'll never see Edgar Wright's Ant-Man. If I were in Feige's, I'd just go crazy with every movie and give 100% freedom to directors to make whatever tf they want and go nuts with it and have a different MCU next to the main one. And even now is the best time to do it, why not let Edgar Wright make an Ant-Man movie and call it something like What If Ant-Man...? This is the perfect opportunity for them to go crazy with the multiverse stuff, but I guess making movies is hard and expensive, but I doubt these movies won't sell. Just give directors full control and hire better writers and writing teams and the word of mouth and the good reviews do the rest, just like Everything Everywhere All at Once.\n\nFor people that are concerned about cameos and think this is gonna be a cameo galore and fanservice, don't worry. The cameos are fairly short, they are great and serve the plot, and are not just there just to be there, and they have some of the most brutal scenes I've seen from MCU. There was one particular scene that you know when you see it, that trod the line between PG-13 and R, and was so brutal that if you showed me the clip of it without context and without telling me anything, I would assume it was a scene from The Boys season 3. Yeah, that level of brutality!\n\nDanny Elfman did the score and it fit the movie and the gothic vibe beautifully and there was a certain battle that I'm not gonna even hint at, but you'll know when you watch the movie, that was just audio-visual delight. I am a little disappointed and sad that they didn't use the amazing Doctor Strange theme Michael Giacchino did, and I think he would've done an amazing job if they kept him, but I guess Danny is Sam's blue-eyed boy. But the score is still good, just wish his iconic theme was used more in this movie.\n\nThe visuals were amazing too, although it still had some that looked really bad, and it seems like Marvel has been lacking with CGI in this phase more than before, even in the tv shows.\n\nBut the thing about the visuals is that even though they are great and a joy to witness, I kinda miss the reality-bending we got in the first movie and No Way Home, I wish they used it here too and went crazier with it.\n\nAnd as for the direction, I gotta say it's pretty good and it's obvious Sam Raimi directed it as it has his fingerprint all over this movie and I loved it. It seems like Marvel is getting a little more open to having visionary directors take the helm and give them freedom. It's obvious that this movie is not given to Sam with 100 percent freedom, but I think they're getting a little bit better and I hope this freedom becomes bigger in the next projects. Sam Raimi does a great job with all the creepy, horror scenes, and the jump scares and this movie is more about witchcraft than it is about wizardry and spells. I really hope they keep doing these different genres and don't just stick to action-comedy as they've been for a long time. It's a breath of a fresh air seeing this being a different kind of superhero movie.\n\nI also really liked that he actually used a good color grading and that the colors and environments are alive and that they don't look like another bland Marvel movie.\n\nI don't think I need to talk about the acting because you already know they all do an amazing job. But surprisingly Wanda is the star of this movie and some people have a problem with that? I get that it's called Doctor Strange and this movie kinda lets Wanda outshine him, but did you also have a problem with Infinity War being more of a Thanos movie, or The Dark Knight is more of a Joker movie? I don't get that people say Doctor Strange had less things to do or even less cool things to do than Infinity War, because it felt to me that they both had more of or the same amount of screen-time and Doctor Strange had obviously more screen time.\n\nAnd America Chavez is a really interesting and a great addition to the MCU and Xochitl Gomez did a good job of portraying her.\n\nSome reviews said that Christine Palmer was again underutilized, which I guess? But I don't know what more they could've done with the fast pacing of this movie and I thought they did a decent job with Palmer anyway. Obviously, and as I said before, this movie could've benefited from some breathers and 20 extra minutes, but it was still fine.\n\nWe also get Ashley Williams of course! And Bruce Campbell is great as ever. You can't have a Sam Raimi movie without Ash!\n\nI also heard some people say that they liked the first one better, which it's ok I guess? You could argue that the pacing of the first movie was better and Stephen Strange had a good development in there, but since the villain sucked in that movie, I cannot say that the first one is better. The villain and \""their\"" motivation in this movie were far better in this movie, and I guess they had some movies and shows to get more development and it's kinda unfair to compare and say this one had more development because duh. But even if this was their first appearance, they still had a better motivation and were a better character anyway. (I'm using \""they\"" to not spoil who the villain is but I think it's obvious for anyone who that is)\n\nIn conclusion, this movie might not be what you think is going to be, so manage your expectations. The acting is great, the direction and Sam Raimi's touch are great and so is the cinematography, the music is good but disappointingly there is little to no use of Doctor Strange's iconic theme, the villain is good, the visuals are great but it needed more visuals and reality-bending from the first one, the horror aspect is fine and gives a fresh look to the MCU, but it's ultimately rushed, the pacing needed some work and needed extra time. I also forgot to say that there are some loose ends left from the first movie that they didn't deal with for some reason and it's not really a continuation of Doctor Strange as it is more a continuation of WandaVision, and in that case, people are kinda right if they think this wasn't that much of a Doctor Strange movie and more Wanda's.\n\nMaybe I'm just a little carried away and I'm giving it an 8 impulsively, and I am doing it as I've done times before, and watching it a second time will show me its flaws better, and yeah it's not a full 8/10 but more like a 7.5 leaning towards 8 and I liked this one more than the first one.\n\nUpdate: Watched it a second time and I think I like it a little less and noticed more problems with it, but I still like it, so I'm changing it to a 7 here."", ""Upvotes"": ""343"", ""Downvotes"": ""206"", ""Reviewer"": ""MamadNobari97""}]"

Like a 'go out to the theatre' film movie.\"" Without poking too much fun at Styles' interview skills - he's right! This is a movie you should see in theatres that I quite enjoyed! While it doesn't fully live up to the promise of its incredible trailers, it surely is a compelling, engaging film and another fantastic work from Olivia Wilde. However, the true standout from this film is Florence Pugh, who deserves all the praise she will receive for her performance here. She is incredible and really shows off her range as an actress, I couldn't get enough of her in this movie! She was absolutely phenomenal and even if you don't like the movie, I assure you that you will love Florence Pugh in it! She truly carries the film, and right from the start you are fully enveloped in her character's conflicts and story. Pugh commands the screen in every scene that she is in - which is pretty much the entire film... one could say she really is the element that holds the film together! If you are a Florence Pugh fan, you'll be in heaven... and if you aren't... you will be by the time the movie is over!\n\nThe rest of the ensemble cast is wonderful here too! Pugh is definitely the standout, but I really loved Chris Pine's performance here too. He has this suave but menacing persona in it, and makes it very hard for you to get a read on what was going through his character's head. And can I just say... they made Pine look really good in this role, his costuming and hair was PERFECT. I also didn't mind Harry Styles, he was good especially considering he doesn't have much acting experience. It was a little hard to take him seriously in some dramatic scenes... but it seemed like he was really trying his best! And if he brought an audience into this film, that's a win. The rest of the cast was great too, it was an awesome ensemble and Olivia Wilde got some great performances out of her actors. She gave a good performance herself in a supporting role, but her direction is the most notable! I liked \""Booksmart\"", but this is a huge step up for her! It is much larger in scale and deals with a lot more complex themes, which Wilde weaves into the film so organically. There is so much attention to detail and an expert use of symbolism to convey themes of control. I loved the aesthetic she brought to the film as well, from the stunning 50s production design and costumes (I loved these) to the phenomenal cinematography. It had this Hollywood high gloss feel to it, and yet had a number of avant-garde qualities that actually worked so well for the film! The film is evocatively shot, and I was amazed at some of the clever ways the cinematographer and Wilde chose to capture certain moments. And I can't mention the technical excellence of the film without mentioning the haunting and disturbing sound design. It worked so well for the film, really setting the tone in such a strong way and playing off the amazing 50s soundtrack the film had! Every beat is felt throughout your body and draws you further into the mayhem ensuing on screen. And the editing was exceptional too, especially in helping to reveal things to the audience without having to expressly tell us. The film's technical merit is impressive right from the very start, and I give all credit to Wilde for this in her excellent sophomore effort.\n\nThis movie is the type of movie we don't normally see these days, and it was quite refreshing. It definitely takes inspiration from other stories and films, such as \""The Stepford Wives\"", and was even reminiscent of \""WandaVision\"", but it manages to put a clever enough spin on these ideas that makes the film as a whole feel more original. Some ideas and elements did feel somewhat half-baked, but the film still did a lot to make them feel more natural and developed within the film! The story itself was right up my alley, it dove right into the mystery right at the beginning and sucked me in within seconds of the movie starting. It has a tight, gripping script with a fantastic twist at the end! Sure, it may be predictable but they put a unique enough spin on it that made it really work for me, I loved the 3rd act! It definitely won't be for everyone, and it depends how believable you find elements related to the twist. But it really came together for me in the end; I was on the edge of my seat and my eyes were wide! The story and ultimately the movie may not be as good as that first trailer promised it would be, if they did one more pass of the script it really could have been perfect, but what we got was still awesome!\n\nThe film is thrilling and at times filled me with dread. It is an excellent (and somewhat erotic) psychological thriller that just worked so well for me! The script is definitely not its strongest component, and in less inspired hands this film could have fallen flat. However, due to Olivia Wilde's strong vision for the film and well-rounded technical strength, exquisite sound and visuals the film bolsters... it actually works! And the cast was incredible too! While it does feature plenty of star power, one thing is for sure, this is Florence Pugh's world and we are all just living in it. This is one of her best performances to date, she elevates this movie to an exceptional level. Her effortless dedication to every element of her performance is impressive, especially considering the on-set drama that may or may not have happened. It is unfortunate the drama has taken focus off the film, but I do hope audiences still go out to experience this great film! Everything came together to create a really solid film that I just ate right up, it worked perfectly for me!

Downton Abbey: A New Era brings all our favorite characters together again in interesting circumstances. Fans will love what's in store in this new film.\n\nDownton Abbey: A New Era focuses on the secret past of the Dowager Countess Violet Crawley (Maggie Smith). She comes into possession of a property in the South of France. Lord Grantham (Hugh Bonneville) and his family head to France to investigate why the villa was given to his mother. Meanwhile back at Downton, Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery) hosts a crew of filmmakers and actors who use the estate as a set for their new film.\n\nIt's so incredible to return to the Downton Abbey era and the Crawley family. Each one is out of their comfort zone in this new movie, which is absolutely hilarious. Lady Mary becomes a voice actress temporarily and seeing Robert hate the film crew for taking over his property is as funny as possible. The Crawleys have seen the times change and preparing for cinema to take over is amazing. It makes audiences realize how this generation saw life change so rapidly. Tom Branson (Allen Leech) is happily married and some new couples flourish in the film too. It's beautiful to see how much the characters have changed since the first time we met them in 2010. This movie focuses on relationships and characters that we haven't seen that often. It's refreshing to watch the pure relationship Daisy (Sophia McShera) and Andrew (Michael Fox) have and I loved watching fan-favorite Mrs. Patmore (Lesley Nicol) chase her love. The wardrobe is as spectacular as ever, even adding some Victorian pieces for the film being madet at Downton. The comedy is brilliant and cunning, reminding us why we love Violet as much as we do.\n\nThere are many messages to take away here. Lady Mary learns to embrace the new era of filmmaking and life as she gets out of her comfort zone and realizes that it's okay to try new things. Lord Grantham learns that, even though being Earl and having property is a big part of his life, it is not everything. He realizes how important his family is to him.\n\nI give Downton Abbey: A New Era 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 14 to 18 plus adults. It releases in theaters May 18, 2022.

Here is a rambling story with too many characters, but who cares? Because it's told so well with each character clearly defined and loveable.\n\nAfter the binge-worthy six-sessions TV series in the early 2010's, the 2019 film, with its visit from royalty, held up well enough to spawn this sequel, Downton Abbey: A New Era, in which the aristocratic Crawley family is crawling into the 1930's, with The Great Depression, wars, and innovations imminent. The film creates a vitality even in a staid Brit world largely because of a robust screenplay and spot-on actors. Not to forget drone shots of the impossibly cinematic estate.\n\nIn fact, no melodramatic villain appears, if you exclude the arch-disturber, Change. Writer Julian Fellowes and director Simon Curtis have crafted a rousing fable about a new era as it approaches the third decade of the 20th century through the lens of a visiting Hollywood production to the Abbey.\n\nMarry that modern incursion to the hidebound Brit tradition and you have a sentimental farewell to the old world, signified by the sharp-witted Dowager Countess Violet (Maggie Smith), who is ready to pass the estate and a newly-added villa in the south of France to the younger Granthams. A formidable subplot is the change the Hollywood production itself must face as sound trounces silent movies and same-sex relationships emerge, galaxies away from our modern acceptance of sexual orientations.\n\nThe most moving scene is when the production learns it has to create a sound track in order to continue filming. Watching them sync the sound (dubbing so to speak) to the actors for the first time since they saw Jolson say a few words in The Jazz Singer is just as if we were in a time machine witnessing that monumental change almost 100 years ago.\n\nDownton Abbey is a state of mind, not a place, where our dreams of upper-class blissful isolation clash with the realities of life both for the rich and the poor.

Still i watched it to see what changes the Hindi version makes to the original or is it just a blatant copy paste.\n\nThe answer is NO! It is not a blatant copy paste. Let me tell you in points about them:-\n\n1. Having not seen the original Drishyam 1 but the Hindi drishyam 1, i didn't knew that Gaitonde's character is a unique addition to the Hindi version. This , even in Drishyam 2 is a masterstroke.\n\n2. Gaitonde lives up to that hateful character he had from the 1st film. The Hindi version has slightly altered the police station interrogation scene in the 2nd half and this is where the Hindi version outclasses the Malayalam version and the difference was Gaitonde.\n\n3. Akshay Khanna as the IG is another masterstroke addition who fills in the shoes of IGP Thomas . While Thomas was direct and strict, Akshay Khanna is sarcastic in his tone and has this evil way of talking that gives him his own identity. Another place where the Hindi version scores full marks. He's done a terrific job.\n\n4. Another thing that gives the Hindi version it's own popularity is the famous \""Satsang\"" confession. When again brought up here, the crowd roared ! Shows you how this Satsang thing has had its own fan following as compared to the confession in the Malayalam version.\n\n5. The fact that certain scenes have been a little altered to avoid being called a blatant copy paste, for example the film begins with a person murdering another and then running in the jungles. The Malayalam version started straight from the running part without much showing the sequence why he was running.\n\n6. The elder daughter's illness was better captured in the Malayalam version. The Hindi one just seems to add it for name sake.\n\n7. The final climax courtroom scene was , imo, better executed in the Malayalam version. The Hindi one felt like it was rushing to the main points of the climax. Also that scene in the court where Vijay and the IG cross each other , this too was a little better in the Malayalam version where George kutty and Thomas crossed each other and that expression on Thomas's face was better.\n\n8. Tabu and even Rajat Kapoor have nothing much to do as the spotlight are taken by Vijay, Akshaye and Gaitonde.\n\nOverall, Drishyam 2 hindi is a very good remake of the original, just like Drishyam 1 was despite change in directors. It almost felt like Abhishek Pathak had the soul of Nishikant Kamat in him while making this film.

Whether that's a good thing or not I'm not so sure but top marks for his choice of Austin Butler to play the title role of Elvis Presley.\n\nAustin Butler had big shoes to fill and Elvis fans won't be disappointed as he portrays the iconic singer over more than 20 years of his life covering the 50s, 60s, and 70s, eras from his childhood and meteoric rise to stardom to his long, slow decline.\n\nThis biographical movie unlike the 2019 movie Judy I'm pleased to say covers the good years as well as the sad years when Elvis left us tragically aged only 42 under identical circumstances to Judy Garland who was 47.\n\nBoth stars burnt out prematurely both were exploited but their fame and legacy of music and film footage will live on for centuries as they are both true historical cultural icons.\n\nAustin Butler really does hold the entire movie together for me he gives much more than an Elvis impersonation which so many performers have done before.\n\nAt times and at certain camera angles Austin Butler looks uncannily identical to Elvis Presley and he sings the early Elvis songbook in his own voice to perfection. Austin's voice is only blended with Elvis's own voice in the later Las Vegas years .\n\nMany other actors in addition to Austin Butler auditioned for the role including Ansel Elgort, Miles Teller, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Harry Styles but the right choice to play Elvis certainly was Austin Butler in my opinion.\n\nUnlike Rami Malik who played Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody and had the Freddie Mercury teeth he wore cast in gold , Austin Butler's transformation really just relies on eye make up ,hairstyle and the tight pants and flamboyant shirts and capes that Elvis wore during his performances.\n\nI'm certain Austin Butler's performance is what prompted the Elvis movie to receive a 12 minute standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival last month. Rami Malik received an Oscar and lip synched the songs so Austin Butler who sings in his own voice should at least get a Best Actor Oscar nomination in 2023.\n\nThere were positives I liked in Baz Luhrmann's Elvis and negatives as much as I admire Tom Hanks as an Actor the role of Colonel Tom Parker who is the storyteller through whose eyes we see the rise and fall of The King of Rock is a despicable and ugly character . While of course he is a central character in the Elvis Presley story I felt telling the story through such an unsympathetic character was unnecessary and I found Tom Hanks Dutch accent and his prosthetic nose a little irritating at times.\n\nThe Cinematography by Mandy Walker is stunning as are the costumes by Baz Luhrmann's 4 time Academy Award winning wife Catherine Martin .\n\nAll biography movies stretch or modify the facts to a certain extent to add more dramatic content and while this story is reasonably accurate Baz has used some poetic licence in some scenes . The emotional meeting of Elvis and the Producer Steve Binder of his 1968 Christmas comeback show at the iconic rusting L. A. Hollywood sign never happened but it's effective.\n\nThe opening introduction scene of Colonel Tom Parker discovering Elvis at the Carnival which I'm sure was inspired by Guillermo del Toro's recent movie Nightmare Alley also never occurred. World events of that time are used as a timeline like the assassination of Bobby Kennedy during taping of an Elvis television show also are fiction but it does add drama to the script.\n\nThere's also a silly hysterical scene where an entire Christmas snow set is built to convince The Colonel that Elvis was going to sing Here Comes Santa Claus in his 1968 comeback show this also apparently was a complete fiction as was the fact that Elvis was persuaded by Parker to enlist in the army rather than being arrested for his suggestive stage gyrations. Elvis did not enlist he was drafted and surrounded by the media when he entered the Army in March 1958.\n\nThose who love Showman Baz Luhrmann's flamboyant highly individual directing style I'm sure will love Elvis I enjoyed it but didn't love it.\n\nThe supporting cast that includes Olivia De Jonge as Pricilla Richard Roxburgh as Vernon Presley Helen Thomson as Gladys and Kodi Smit-McPhee as Jimmie Rodgers Snow are all good but in my view could have been featured more .\n\nI personally think he lacks subtlety and while putting on a great show his script in this case focuses to much on the character of Colonel Tom Parker and as I recently referred to heroes as main characters in stories Colonel Tom Parker was no hero. Colonel Tom reminds me more of Rumpelstiltskin in more ways than one Elvis turned the straw that Colonel Tom Parker gave him into gold and like the Princess in the Grimm's Fairy Tale sadly Elvis paid a very high price."", ""Upvotes"": ""436"", ""Downvotes"": ""132"", ""Reviewer"": ""tm-sheehan""}, {""Title"": ""Oscar Worthy"", ""Rating"": ""10"", ""Review Content"": ""I normally am not a fan of Baz Luhrman.

I was 11 when he died and it came as a big shock. In rural Norfolk where we lived mostly 20 years in the past so it seemed that he had only just arrived. I spent a long time after following the legend. The Kurt Russel movie, the odd \""That's the Way it is / Was\"" documentaries - stylistically plundered for this movie and of course all the movies. Owning 40 Greatest Hits was pretty much issued to you growing up. Then Punk Rock and New Wave came and Elvis just became the distant past, even if he did shock his audience in a way Johnny Rotten could only dream. Occasionally American Trilogy would come on the radio and I'd crank it up and do an Elvis impersonator sing-along, \""Wisha was, inna lanna cotton\"" I played it on my excited drive to see this movie I had been waiting for, saying to my partner, \""If this song is not referenced in the movie, I'll be stunned, it is definitive Elvis\"".\n\nOnce the film started, it was the first track we see enacted by the incredibly brilliant Austin Butler who nails it. Sadly, there is not much else good to say about this movie beyond his performance. It makes sense of course that Baz Luhrmann would open with that. Luhrmann is never one to use a nutcracker when there is a sledgehammer he can bang an idea a few times with until you get it. That's my point. This is not really an Elvis movie. It is a Tom Parker movie that wishes it was an Elvis movie. I am not sure you can be that dark and cynical about Elvis life and hope to get away with it considering what baggage the typical audience are likely to bring to the show. For Elvis to be portrayed as this easily manipulated kid, when anyone who watched the documentaries mentioned above knew The King was always in charge. If you tip the weight of the narrative to Colonel Tom you have to reduce the personality of Elvis. Don't get me wrong when I first heard rumours about this movie I was very keen for a Colonel Tom movie played by Tom Hanks but for that movie to work it needs a less important Elvis, that's a tough trick to pull off.\n\nThis movie is only coherent to an Elvis fan. To others not plugged into the folklore, myth and legend, it is long and boring with Luhrmann over egging his point and being cynical and depressive. He either fast forwards too much that is relevant or dwells on insignificance to bolster and pad out the Colonel Tom con artist. There is the art of the conman, the huckster, referenced through this movie. In reality, the biggest card trick is shuffled by the director who promises us a celebration of Elvis but delivers a woeful, tedious tale of a mediocre manager who got lucky clinging to a rocket after it had already launched. Butler is brilliant, no doubt, Hanks is hammy at best. Luhrmann tries to use Elvis to paint Tom Parker which is like I said, using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.\n\nFun in places but subtle it ain't.

That's because of Aubrey Plaza, who plays the anti-hero for our times\n\nThe eponymous bad girl of the Sundance breakout Emily the Criminal is as much a victim of society's neglect as she is of her own self-centeredness. Yet Emily (Aubrey Plaza) is self-sufficient and capable of kicking serious butt, not in a professional, martial-arts way, but in a way that mirrors her determination.\n\nIt's not difficult to see why she is easily seduced from food-delivery work to credit card scamming given the $70K in school loans, half a degree, and her permanent record of aggravated assault and DUI. The clarity and tension with which writer/director John Patton Ford unfolds Emily's arc are admirable--anyone in the audience can immediately identify with her dilemma-to remain poor or to make enough to erase debt and live comfortably.\n\nEmily's only real friend is her old college chum, Liz (Megalyn Echikunwoke), who gets her an ad-agency interview with a mean womansplaining exec (Gina Gershon) that serves as the last testament to what Emily will suffer for every job she interviews: facing her criminal record and being offered, in this case, an internship for almost a half year without pay.\n\nHooking up with an enterprise that scams credit cards is almost a given; hooking up with the middle manager, Yusuf (Theo Rossi), is also a given, given that he is handsome, charming, and warm hearted. The drama actually comes alive when she begins scamming, showing a natural talent and aggressive enough, unlike other modern heroines, to escape by wit or just smarts with the help of a taser or boxcutters.\n\nThroughout Emily the Detective, Plaza plays a decent millenial who has been buffeted by fate and her own stern affect to find salvation in accelerating crime, for which she has talent. Emily is not really the criminal that Yusuf's colleagues are; rather she's a bright woman caught in a social satire both trenchant and scary.\n\nYou'll love Plaza in this role.

Hilary goes about her business, does sexual favors for the boss in his office, and eats dinner alone at home. Things change when a young black man, Stephen, is hired at the Empire. Hilary takes Stephen under her wing and shows him interesting things about the theater and its employees.

Nearly all of them have backstory and struggles introduced, but not much, if anything, is ever done with it.\n\nThe \""story\"" is made up of runtime-padding dramatic beats that always begin in a very strong manner but are always either resolved without any real struggle or conflict or are abandoned entirely. No consequences are ever seen or felt, and it dampens the impact of the whole film.

A story about a woman (tick) mental health and Racial Tensions in 80's Britain (tick) an an ode to cinema (tick).\n\nBut it was one of the worst films I have watched this year. Incredibly disjointed, sloppy and cheating it's way through the running time. One of the most insulting things, actually, two of the most insulting things about this film aside from its tact on - paint by numbers pastiche - was the serious 'Exoticism' - right wing Len's played off as liberal arts. The second thing is it's central character unfulfilled characterisation and backstory related to the devastation on mental health. The lead (Olivia Coleman) gives a committed performance forging her performance forward despite the arbitrary writing. It's the same with the supporting cast, all historically incredible talents alongside Olivia, but you can see they are grappling with the script and their lack of character journeys - doing the best they can with a film that overplays its hand as a worthy themes but, frankly, lacks heart in every human way possible. It's like watching a bad - overhyped film school short film that is agonisingly long.\n\nThen, there are the very bad lines - very bad.\n\nAt theQ&A event, Sam the writer/director called his film a story about 'Race' but the actual wording he is missing in his vocab is 'Racism'. It features racism in the story - arguably, it's the penultimate turning point for Michael's character it's not racial tension - but racisim and Sam had a problem saying this word. (Sidenpre: don't make a film about monumental themes, aiming for the glory, when you cannot stand by the work it's a waste of our viewing time and production time and money). But I have to say, Sam leans into a Len's that is embedded in exoticism and I found that troubling in this day and age. Also, the sex scenes from the jump were ill-timed, over-sensationalised and weakened the picture. Talk about relying on 'sex' to sell a film!!\n\nI think if Sam and his production company 'Neal Street' want to explore themes of monumental weight they should be braver about standing next to the picture they are promoting. Using language like 'Race' when they mean Racism - is weak, archaic and only proves to show their Lens is in the wrong material. And, I have to say the cinema acts as a silent character in the film. This is filmed beautifully (aesthetically) and there is no point being in denial about how much space and time 'the cinema' takes up as a character. It's better for Sam to own the subjects/themes being explored here then attempt to walk them back or worse still, play sloppy bbc journalist.\n\nAlso, why did Sam feel he wanted and needed to tell this story? During the Q&A he dances around his mother's mental health which must have been tough as I suffer with MH myself. But he dances around this, and in the film just like his Q&A, the central character illness / condition is remarkably vague and mysterious but not on a cool way in a confused writer way so you don't settle into the film. Perhaps, here is bold thought, Sam and his production company should have made room for a more authentic director to tell this story or a writer. And here is even bolder thought, a woman should have made this film and a woman. It's not a story Sam Mendes should have made, and I think he and Neal Street know this - but they are going to do everything humanly possible to promote a film that was a waste of time and problematic. Did we expect anything less from someone who is still chasing the glory of cinema (Sam Mendes) and not the heart of great storytelling.\n\nAlso, thank goodness Michael made any appearance in the Q&A - despite the patronising eyes, jests between Sam and Pippa Harris, this young man managed to breath some life into the stale, muddy, tone-deaf and underwhelming viewing experience.

Wow wow wow! Imagine if Dr Strange, Limitless, The Matrix, Click, Rick & Morty, Star Wars, Ratatouille and Manchester By the Sea combined to become a film, Everything Everywhere All at Once is the one! Now you must be wondering, how could Ratatouille and The Matrix complement each other to be in the same movie? 🤣🤣🤣 This question should be THE reason you should go support this film now in cinemas!\n\nProduced by A24, an independent film company, I was surprised at how they have pulled this off. Half of the film is located at an office, which is understandable considering A24 produces low or semi-budget films. But it's such a wonder how this movie could be so good with only so few places the movie took place for the first hour. What's even better is EEAAO occurred within closed and overcrowded spaces that may slightly trigger people experiencing ADHD, hypersensitivity and claustrophobia, pushing the film into maximum impact.\n\nThis film is filled with action-packed sequences that will blow you brains out! It's fun, exhilarating, creative, hilarious and never-been-done-before! Adding up with the out-of-the-world concept and unique storyline, every fighting scene seems appropriately done and even if there's just so many styles and tones of scenes coming out from the screen, fitting is the right word to describe them.\n\nEEAAO seems like any other movie at the beginning but when all hell breaks loose, the story becomes increasingly complex as it explains the world revolving around the central character, propelling the plot into motion. Meticulously explained, the narrative manages to be exciting and outrageously wild but reasonable within its own multiverse contexts.\n\nMichelle Yeoh, our Malaysian actress 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻, is excellent in this, proving that she's fluid in bringing out the best of her multiple character(s). Complicated as it is, she knew what kind of project she's doing and it just shows how dedicated she is at acting. It's not easy to play her role and it's definitely not easy to create multiple personas interconnected by different universes and dimensions, with separate storylines, all destined to have the same fate. This is an Oscar-worthy performance, and whether or not if Yeoh got nominated lies on the decision if the Oscar recognizes speculative fiction as a genre acceptable to compete with other highly-appraisal films.\n\nThere were many genuinely laugh-out-loud moments throughout, NOT the one where you're forced to laugh just because everyone is laughing to avoid the awkwardness surrounding the audience in the hall, but the one that it's just funny you're having a truly good time. The script and performance help to amplify the comedic moment but the most special thing is that it's aware of its VFX effects and the team knows how to level up/down the intensity and realness of the CGI. How so? The CGI is very good, but there are times that the CGI is made to be purposely bad, like you're watching a short film by a bunch of ambitious varsity students, and it works! It works because everyone in the theater was laughing, it clicks just right with the moments and scenes you're watching. You'll laugh at how bad it is in a good way!\n\nIf there's one dislike from this film is that it's gonna be a tough watch for some people. Like mentioned earlier, those with ADHD and hypersensitivity may be triggered with the intensity of this film. Also, the storyline is difficult for some to digest due to its complexity of its universe-building. The film is promoted as being light and fun but...EEAAO is weighty, dark, bizarre and surreal, only those who have what it takes can appropriately understand the building block storytelling.\n\nVerdict: Mind-bending and mind-blowing, Everything Everywhere All at Once masters its building block storytelling that feels like an acid trip worth experiencing and that experience... can only be felt once in a lifetime.

Fortunately, Fall is not one of those films, doing very well to handle the entire ordeal in rough 84 minutes. The pacing is decent, finding good ways to utilize the moment to get character development while also keeping the suspenseful element strong. It's a nice mixture of the two elements and helps bring at least decent representation of both thrills and drama spills.\n\nGreat Musical Score: This movie is one of those where music really makes a difference at those key elements. Fall may not have the biggest or most unique track list, but it utilizes the limited song title quite well to really add the finesse and inspiration these scores do. Cherry Pie as a casual rock out moment and then as an inspiration cheer was quite fun and a good connecting point. While orchestral scores make up those killer finishing shots that are amazing across the board. There is not much I can say pass this, but perhaps Fall will at least make you want to listen to the 80s song again.\n\nMessage Is Powerful: So many movies these days are about delivering that gigantic message to hopefully inspire the \""change\"" that we all \""need.\"" Fall has a couple of deep messages that do well to display some important topics, and most of them are pretty good. There is some trauma, no surprise right as these movies go, and how to handle these moments or at least the mindset some face, is decently glimpses in this film. Other moments like facing the fears, the will to survive, and pushing yourself are very big in this film, and there is surprising wisdom and class in the dialogue and filming to really show this message. It's target audience in particular should be inspired the most and find the words in particular worthy of being on your social media quotes.\n\nActing Is Good: This movie heavily focuses on two characters and the actresses are the ones to hold much of the attention of the film. Let's get this out of the way, they are very attractive, one the bosom blonde with that fiery energy, the other one delicate gorgeous and sensitive. With those superficial components out of the way, the girls are very good at displaying the qualities you need for this very focused movie. Morgan, for what little he is in it, does well with his time, and manages to deliver his few lines with fantastic abilities. Gardner is vibrant and playing the typical thriller type woman you see in these films. She's bold, she brings the one liners and meme looks that modern generations love, and of course representing the new generation of humans. She's bold, she talks a lot, and yet has some deeper layers that come out as the film progresses to help break the superficial mirror a bit. Yet it's Currey who claims my vote for best acting. As Becky, she really brings so many qualities that I grasped onto, her story deeper, more developed, and more realistic to help round out the character. Most of her acting is solid and sincere, and was the character that annoyed me the least with the direction that they took. Well done!\n\nThe Makeup: You can guess that trouble does eventually ensue if you have seen the trailers, which means the potential to suffer from the consequences. Fall is all about making the suffering look real, the make-up and effects solid as the girls gradually look dehydrated, exhausted and exposed to the element. It adds that suspense and experience effect, really selling to me just how miserable something like this would be if it happened. And when other things happen, they pull out some impressive tricks to make it believable.\n\nGreat Presentation: I can't say much about this, but let's just say that this presentation was solid for telling the story they wanted. Fall does a great job of laying out the story, and plotting out gradual transition of this journey, bringing things into a gradual build up to again help keep that attempt at suspense going. It is mostly very natural, and the editing solid to deliver so much in such a short amount of time. And when the climax hits, all the effects come together to finish the thrill ride in that last drop.\n\nThe Cinematography: My favorite part of the whole movie, the cinematography is key to what makes this movie the spectacle it is. This film really pulled a lot of tricks to make the tower look as foreboding as it should be. MacGregor finds all the right angle to get the scene going, from upward shots of the tower, to the angles looking down the valley below to establish the magnitude of the climb. Then he takes it one step further finding the perfect shot to continue showing everything the girls are experiencing including: close ups of them really struggling, the dynamic angle changes as they dangle from ropes and the fleeting shots as they try to solve their predicaments. For so many movie pieces, MacGregor, and the editing team afterwards, really brings it all together to give you the Thriller element without the shaky camera. And then there are other moments I can't share that help immerse me into the movie, helping give that overall picture of what they are doing. I can't say much more, so let's move to my limitations for this movie.\n\nDISLIKES:\n\nMore Morgan: Let's face it. He's a top billed actor and there is more we could have done with the talent that Morgan can bring. Whether more time at the beginning, more integration into the other's life, or even shots of him trying to find them would have been welcome. These moments would have integrated the story a little better, and brought that extra angle to help the solution be a little more realistic than what they did. Though, the solution is definitely unique.\n\nMore Story Needed: There were so many avenues to explore for the two girls being on the tower as long as they were. Fall had a very big opportunity to utilize the secrets they were holding and gradually reveal how deep the rabbit hole went. While from a time sake they hit the highlights, from another element they skimped on helping further explore the motifs they were trying to present. Having Morgan's character involved could have given even more to give these girls the best depth possible.\n\nAnimal Cruelty I did not Need to See: Animal cruelty is potentially something I do not like to see. I can handle if it has a purpose, and for one of them it did work for the sake of the story. However, an early scene showed something I don't enjoy seeing and could have been edited out or done a different way. Does it accomplish the horror, foreshadowing, and mood to come? Yep, but again, it crosses a line for me.\n\nSome In your Face Dialogue That's Cheesy: One thing that modern writers seem to have to do is rub the dialogue in your face to prove the point. Much of the dialogue was either okay or good, but there are other moments, particularly at the beginning, and some of Hunter's dialogue, that is really grueling. Like out of a book of Full House, the \""inspirational\"" comes out a bit cheesy and I was just waiting for the actions to finally prove what the words could not do for me. I don't know if it was the writing, the direction, or the acting, perhaps all three, but those in your face moments did not work for me. Again, I think the target audience in this aspect will love it, enjoying the theatrics that really blow it up. But goers like me, may pray for something better and just bite their tongues to get by it.\n\nStupidity and Suspense of Disbelief Get A Little Out of Hand: One thing that is tough to avoid in these movies, is the various actions that occur to get the characters into the mess. Champion thrillers for me, are the ones that know how to craft it organically, but Fall's case follows the trend of our characters being stupid. The level of stupidity is kind of extreme, a bit insulting given the lessons they already learned. I mean climbing a rusted, banned tower for thrills... really that is the plot. Then as things progress, you see just how poor one of the characters is, and how stupid they seem to selectively be to push them to have to MacGyver up some quick fix solutions. Those moments are kind of too much for me, and could have changed the movie big time if they had just taken their own advice to save them trouble. And, the series of unfortunate events that happens gets a little ridiculous at times to the point of the stroke of bad luck being a tad too much. It hits comic relief and helps drag out the thrills, but at times I was like, I just predicted that would happen and you did it. This adds more cheese factor to the movie and was probably the biggest frustration of the film for me.\n\nThe VERDICT:\n\nFall was a bit deeper than I had anticipated from the trailers and cast. It blends elements of other thriller films in this category, and expands past the sorority girl motif to give us better characters. The messages are strong, the presentation and layout linear and decently paced, with acting that helps craft a better quality situation than what we got. Of course it's the visual and sound effects, including music, that really make the movie as intense as it is, with a fantastic blend of shots edited together to stir up any acrophobia you might have. With all the good, the movie needed ironically a little more time to fully flesh out the characters, alongside adding more time with Morgan's character as well.

He's told often that he can't do something or that life gives him hardship and his stubborn streak kicks in. To a lot of people, his persistence is read as silly and frustrating. To a lot of people he should be beaten to death in an alley somewhere in some small rural town he hails from. Until a fateful night which puts a lot of his life in perspective. Unfortunately, I don't feel that moment is enough to generate the turn of the cheek. But, writer/director Rosalind Ross was smart enough to show how little Stuart actually changes. He instead uses his blue-collar nastiness for good rather than evil. Funny to me, to say the least. I wish they would've played more in that world. Where people expect him to be pious and uptight but ends up being a thug in a collar. There may have been extra chuckles to be mined there, ala Harrison Ford getting ice cream on his face in \""Witness.\""\n\nWell, the structure itself isn't anything new. And if you've seen a redemption story, you know what follows. But Mark Wahlberg does an exceptional job getting into the attitude of Stu. In a wild universe, he is Dirk Diggler grown up and trying to find salvation. Mirroring him is Mel Gibson, who plays his father who has his own moment of goodness. It's not much, but it is enough.\n\nYes, there are a few moments that get heavy handed. That's not to say, these things didn't occur in real life. Stu is brash, and edgy and punch-drunk dumb. He goes with the theory that he doesn't know until someone tells him it's wrong, then he doubles down. His logic is that if Christ wanted him alive, it must be that he wants him to double down for him.\n\nI've no doubt that director Ross, whom is in a relationship with Mel Gibson, tapped the lighter side of the situation. In different hands, this plays as a broad parody. This was reigned in enough for it to hit where it needs to. Speaking of which...Jackie Weaver is such a blessing to watch. She embraces dialogue that would fall flat coming out of most actors' mouths and hits the right beats. Completely nails the humor beats without knowing she is funny. She is the quintessential White trash mom with a kind heart. She has a lot of darkness in her, but they do such a brilliant thing...and not make that the centralized burden to her life. She presses forward and referees two bulls. Though she is separated from her husband Mel, she harbors the right degree of resentment to a former relationship. The dynamics of their family are very clear.\n\nAny way, this is a surprisingly funny flick. I found myself laughing many times at some of the absurdity that occurs. Special shout-out to Teresa Ruiz who plays the love interest. She is warm, kind and when things go wrong, does exhibit the proper reaction and emotions. She is fantastic in this!\n\nGo check it out.

He would instead direct another Stephen King adaptation, Christine (1983).",United States,English,4.6,(24K),"[{""Title"": ""Almost A Clinic In How NOT To Adapt A Stephen King Novel"", ""Rating"": ""2"", ""Review Content"": ""Many adaptations of Stephen King novels exist--on film or television--that aren't very good. It is quite frankly just really, really difficult to translate masterful textual stories onto the big screen. But even amidst that mediocrity, Firestarter might be the worst effort I've ever beheld.\n\nFor a very basic overview, Firestarter tells the story of young Charlie McGee (Ryan Kiera Armstrong), a girl imbued with pyro-kinetic mental abilities--in other words, the ability to create/control fire. Hidden away from society by a father (Zac Efron) & mother (Sydney Lemmon) who perpetuated her condition as part of a collegiate experiment, they are eventually found out and pursued by a shadowy government agency and mercenary Rainbird (Michael Greyeyes) in particular.\n\nSkipping right to the point, 2022's Firestarter intentionally undercuts everything that makes the novel retain any sort of iconic status. Some examples:\n\n-The Lot Six experiment flashbacks (with college-age Mr. & Mrs. McGee) are some of the most compelling material in the book. Here? Relegated to opening-credit background filler.\n\n-The tension between whether or not Charlie should train herself to control her special abilities? Used in a couple of 30-second snippets and then discarded entirely.\n\n-One of the book's hallmarks was the separation (over a long period of time) of Charlie and her beloved father, which sets up a perfect slow-burn to the explosive climax. That isn't even attempted here--instead, all that material is laughable condensed into the film's final 15-20 minutes.\n\nI am very rarely tempted to stoop to 1-star level on any entertainment property, but this movie came dangerously close. The only reason I even bumped it up to 2-stars? Because Efron was perfectly cast and would have been perfect for his role, had not the entire thing around him been a flame-out (pardon the pun).\n\nIn short, Firestarter is simply a hollowed-out vehicle for utilizing the King name (and, oddly enough, a John Carpenter-and-son score) to get a few eyeballs. I hate being that crass, but this film deserves it. Not one ounce of care was put into the crafting of interesting characters or plot pacing."", ""Upvotes"": ""219"", ""Downvotes"": ""35"", ""Reviewer"": ""zkonedog""}, {""Title"": ""Pretty bad when a rehashed John Carpenter score is the best thing about it."", ""Rating"": ""3"", ""Review Content"": ""I grew up on the Drew Barrymore version.

He is an orphan with a troubled childhood, so aunties in his community keep a check on him every now and then to know if he is doing fine.\n\nThe plot is quite interesting until the intermission block arrives and makes it yet another revenge story. The teasers were deceptive, and you might wonder if it's a dentist-plus-serial-killer plot. However, it's much more underwhelming than that and goes haywire just after an hour of its runtime. Without a grip that the cast can hold, the plot becomes wafer-thin and overly predictable. However, it's quite interesting to witness a change in Kartik, and he will make you stay with his character for a longer time. However, none of the other cast members contributes to this effort.\n\nThe two-hour-long film is divided into two parts. One makes up a story about how a dentist's life is turned upside down by a small mistake he made and how he plans to get things back to normal by doing the most dangerous things. Kartik in the titular role keeps a very innocent and naive face throughout, but the fire ignited in him takes the course of the rest of the film, which looks believable despite the modern times we live in.\n\nThe sadistic pleasure that each of the characters has in seeking revenge might have looked good on paper, but it was plain funny and laughable in many instances. For example, the character of Raymond Nariman (Karan A. Pandit) as Kainaz Irani's (Alaya F.) boyfriend is just reduced to a caricature. After a point in time, his dialogue delivery seemed offensive, as it doesn't start with a Parsi accent but heavily relies on it later. At the screening, the moment he started coming on screen, people started laughing, knowing that some stupidity was going to take place then and there. Well, he delivers, and although I wouldn't have been able to describe it in one word, a cop does it by calling him a \""protein shake.\""\n\nAlaya F, who made her debut in 2020 with Jawaani Jaaneman, looked promising when she forayed onto the big screen. However, the character just doesn't do justice to the potential that we saw about two years ago. The actor, with a vengeful and selfish motive, felt more like a series vamp, and it was not good enough to entertain or leave you intrigued. Even the disturbing camera work, which shows close-ups of her beauty, such as her perfect teeth or toned legs and cleavage, is disturbing. Her change from an abusive wife to a vengeful single woman is too easy, and her appearance shows this more than anything else.\n\nKartik Aaryan as Freddy has given his best performance in his career. The actor learned about the project and completed the assignment as requested. Even the tiniest details, which might seem unimportant, are handled perfectly and make an impression. The film, however, does not entirely do justice to the character, which is the biggest drawback to what Kartik left to seek.\n\nFreddy directed by Shashanka Ghosh, Parvez Sheikh, who penned the screenplay. But it's the screenplay that is the weakest link in the whole film. The linear format, the characters, the runtime-everything has been in place-but it's the plot with a climactic interval that takes away the highs that it was set out for. The last ten minutes make it interesting but don't deliver the punch that the whole film needed. Even the dialogue by Aseem Arrora doesn't help the film in any way.\n\nPritam Chakraborty, who has been the music director of the year in Hindi, is also the composer of Freddy. The two songs from the film, Kaala Jaadu and Tum Jo Milo, have quite a charm that you might want to add to your playlist.\n\nFreddy has so many plot holes that even Kartik Aaryan's performance isn't enough to save the film. The actor can save the movie, but the latter doesn't share mutual feelings. Thriller films can lose the charm they create because of the predictability factor.

This movie goes pretty off the rails and for good reason. Writer Lauryn Kahn is no stranger to rom-coms having several flops in the past. For this feature, she toys around with the horror genre to give a unique perspective both taken literally and metaphorically. The first 30-minutes are setup like a pleasing romantic movie. I quite enjoyed that beginning. Daisy Edgar-Jones and Sebastian Stan have a cute relationship and great chemistry, which lasts throughout. After that first half hour, the movie starts to pick up and show a darker side. In fact, the opening credits don't happen until then. What comes next is absurd and chilling. Without Mimi Cave's direction, her feature debut fun fact, I doubt the movie would work. She makes this both an uncomfortable and entertaining watch all together. Her techniques may not all be foreign to the horror genre and it definitely can be predictable at times, yet I feel she pulls it off.\n\nI mentioned our two leads before, and they get even better as the movie progresses. Edgar-Jones gives a fully committed performance proving once again she's a great newcomer within the past few years. I really liked her character and how she's able to pull of a good performance to please others in the most desperate of times. Sebastian Stan does well in this role and is completely mesmerizing. Once this hits Hulu in March, there are going to be a few meme-able moments with him and quite the talk surrounding his character. Another good performance comes from Jojo T. Gibb's as the friend trying to piece this mystery together. There's a couple characters that make their entrance but feel like they serve no purpose once they get their time to shine. In the climax, I expected more from them but their works are easily resolved. And the movie ends abruptly if you ask me. As a whole, the runtime is close to two hours. It overstays its welcome with scenes that go nowhere and a few missing pieces never to return to. As much as I liked the beginning, I feel as if that could've been chopped down some even though the half hour mark throws you in for a loop. Not everything is entirely new and it could be better, but the performances and Mimi Cave's work pulls it together. This will for sure gain a cult following in the future and connect with some in such a way.

It starts off as a romantic character drama, as the Gehraiyaan trailers and songs have hinted at. An aimless woman (Deepika Padukone) is trying to pick between two guys and their polar-opposite philosophies, and a man who takes no prisoners (Siddhant Chaturvedi) is trying to have it all and juggle two worlds. But Gehraiyaan transforms into another beast over the course of its long 148 Minutes run-time, becoming more and more plot and event-driven. It's been described by \""domestic neo-noir\"" by the Gehraiyaan cast and director Shakun Batra, but it's not that - Gehraiyaan bears no traits of the neo-noir genre. It's just a poor relationship love-drama.\n\nGehraiyaan primarily revolves around the lives of the aforementioned two characters. Alisha Khanna (Deepika Padukone) is a 30-year-old yoga instructor - she's been in a six-year-long relationship with Karan Arora (Dhairya Karwa) who quited his lucrative ad copywriter job and is now a struggling and unemployed novel writer. Alisha feels stuck in life, her career isn't going anywhere and she thinks she's moored to her boyfriend. And there's Zain Siddiqui (Siddhant Chaturvedi), a real estate developer who's engaged to Alisha's cousin Tia Khanna (Ananya Panday). Though Alisha and Tia grew up around each other, Tia is actually closer to Karan as they studied together in the US. As Alisha says early in Gehraiyaan, she knows her cousin through her boyfriend.\n\nReturning to India after a while, Tia invites Alisha and Karan to spend a weekend with them at their Alibaug beachside bungalow. It's how Alisha and Zain's paths cross for the first time - and soon they discover they have more in common with one another than with their respective beaus. For one, they both like to think of themselves as outsiders. They are also similar in that they both have a traumatic past. And even though he's now in fiancée territory, Zain can't stop himself from flirting constantly with Alisha. You know where this is going - after all, the Gehraiyaan marketing machine has told you already. Alisha and Zain start seeing one another behind Tia and Karan's backs, which naturally leads to all sorts of complications. Though it's more than what you might expect.\n\nThese are the best portions of Gehraiyaan - the first 30 minutes or so - and Shakun Batra does well to develop the characters. Deepika Padukone's feels the most fleshed out. She's ambling through life, never ready to take charge, and she has convinced herself she has the worst luck. It's possibly a coping mechanism. Alisha doesn't want to end up like her mother who felt suffocated in her own relationship, but by reminding herself of this fact every day, it's almost as if she wills it to happen. Deepika Padukone appropriately plays Alisha as insecure and a bit bitter.\n\nFollowing the first act that's largely told through Alisha's perspective, the bulk of the second shifts to flesh out Zain. Siddhant Chaturvedi brings a cheeky and menacing edge to Zain, though I couldn't help but feel that the character slid into generic territory. Gehraiyaan is clearly interested in showing that the guy who takes what he wants is clearly a symbol of toxic masculinity today. When driven into a corner, Zain isn't beyond gaslighting his loved ones and not owning up to his BS. But it's also here that Gehraiyaan gets dragged into unnecessary narrative beats - which not only elongate the film's runtime, but also detract from what was until then a solid exploration of human nature.\n\nThe most useless thing though is the pivotal moment I've hinted at, which careens Gehraiyaan and sinks it into an abyss. Not only does it break the movie, it relies on a character intentionally behaving in a dumb manner. Naturally, it feels artificially constructed - like the writers are pulling strings. Unable to write scenes that would push the characters in a meaningful manner, Gehraiyaan opts for a frivolous musical montage.\n\nThe cinematography otherwise, from Kaushal Shah, is elegant and harsh. It's not a combination, don't worry. Batra and Shah aren't afraid to push into their actor's faces during intense moments, but they also pull back to showcase their dreamy lives that frequently involve chilling on a yacht or by the beach-house pool.\n\nUltimately, Gehraiyaan is a confused movie - one that sets itself up nicely at basecamp, only to climb up the wrong mountain. The fall is not gracious. Gehraiyaan further suffers from the expectations it itself built. Caught in a place where they didn't know how to sell the movie without spoiling its secrets, Dharma and Amazon's marketing machine sold it as a full-on romantic drama. I'm not saying the trailers are misleading, but they leave out so much. The impression audiences have of the movie before they hit play is not what the movie is for most of its runtime. This isn't exactly the film's fault, but it's not like Gehraiyaan pulls off the switcheroo effortlessly. Instead, it sinks to the bottom - and all life is drained out of it when it re-emerges from the depths."", ""Upvotes"": ""139"", ""Downvotes"": ""130"", ""Reviewer"": ""cs_rahul_prasad""}, {""Title"": ""Lust,cheating and infidelity"", ""Rating"": ""1"", ""Review Content"": ""This movie is just a sophisticated version of any C grade movie.

The next moment, she learns that her own sister has eloped with the groom, and they both marry each other. The sister's boyfriend, heartbroken, consoles the girl, and eventually these two fall in love. In the meantime, those two eloped lovers are having a troubled marriage. Wait, I was just talking about John Huston's old Hollywood classic, \""In This Our Life\"" (1942), starring two of the greatest actresses of all time-Bette Davis and Olivia De Havilland. Shakun Batra's Gehraiyaan reminded me of that film at the initial stage, but as it moved forward, I realised that it was a different one. There were similarities, like the Love-quartet involving sisters, but that was just about the basic plot, not the detailed one. Gehraiyaan goes deeper into relationship issues caused by professional crisis and conflict between love and business. That's all. Batra's Kapoor & Sons looked like a complete family thing because it involved the entire family at the same time and at the same place, while Gehraiyaan works for individuals at different places but at the same time.\n\nAlisha Khanna, 30, ambitious, now finds herself at a crossroads in life. Her six-year-long relationship has grown monotonous. Her career seems to be hitting a lot of roadblocks, and just when she had begun to accept this reality as unchangeable, the arrival of her cousin, Tia, and her fiancé, Zain, with whom she bonds over a troubled past and a common wish to break free from its confines. The story charts the journey of Alisha and Zain as they fall in love and confront the ghost of their past on the path they take to avoid it. Expectedly, some terrible consequences follow to make the mess even worse, but then it finds a nice getaway through it. Remember Montgomery Clift from \""A Place in the Sun\"" (1951)? Siddhant Chaturvedi's character will remind you of that (hopefully, it's not a spoiler) - but there are different implications to conclude it. Batra and his co-writers' rip-off of multiple flicks still stands pretty much original, owing a favour to its urbanised climax. Not great, but definitely good enough.\n\nGehraiyaan is mainly led by three actors: Deepika Padukone, Ananya Panday, and Siddhant Chaturved. Dhairya Karwa doesn't really seem like a lead character. He is more of a supporting actor, similar to Rajat Kapoor, and both have more screen time than Naseeruddin Shah. Rest, it's all about the trio. Deepika Padukone and Siddhant Chaturvedi's steamy chemistry is indeed something to watch, but their performances have won the race here. Siddhant still carries that \""Gully Boy\"" tone; it looks a bit unnecessary at the beginning, but becomes familiar afterwards. Deepika Padukone's sizzling hot avatar may cause you a slight diversion from the act; however, she captures it before it's gone too far. Ananya is that perfect urban girl even in real life, so there's no way she can go wrong with her natural features on the big screen. Deepika's character was a little contradictory to this urban thing I'm mentioning again and again, as she plays a middle-class working girl, but with Ananya, everything falls into place. The casting director is definitely at merit here for such a lovely casting coup.\n\nWhat works in Gehraiyaan is the gripping storytelling. It's a long film with a runtime of 148 minutes (that's definitely too long) and the soul of its context is too short to convey the extension. Nevertheless, the screenplay is very pacy and engaging. There is not a moment when you can move your steady neck from the screen, and it goes on for two hours, almost. The problem appears in the last 20 minutes, when it loses its grip and its quota of new elements is over. There is nothing left but cliches. Thankfully, all the songs in the film are situational. \""Doobey\"" and \""Beqaboo\"" both work fine as long as they have situations to carry them. The cinematography is very nice, and the background score definitely adds to the mood-making frames\n\nKapoor & Sons and now Gehraiyaan. Shakun Batra is definitely a director to watch out for in urban cinema. His detailing of small, small things is commendable, and the way he presents his characters without any compromises is a fancy treat for his audience. His cinema is never made for the masses and is never even supposed to please them. The same goes with Gehraiyaan, only I am not damn sure because maybe they will enjoy those intimate scenes as to their comfort and forget what it's all about. Yes, that's the question. Was so much adultery really needed here? I don't think so. One or two kisses are fine, and even a few abusive words are fine, but here it's like raining kisses and storming the 'F' word. Superfluous! Rest assured, Batra has made a sensible urban cinema for an urban audience. These relationship issues planted by professional problems aren't anything new, but this film makes them look new and fresh. Gehraiyaan is a perfect fit for OTT with an \""A\"" certificate. Our mass audience, which fills most of the seats in theatres, is not yet ready for this. Let's swim in the ocean of Gehraiyaan this Valentine's weekend, created by this fantastic team but only if you are an adult.\n\nRATING - 6/10*"", ""Upvotes"": ""64"", ""Downvotes"": ""71"", ""Reviewer"": ""SAMTHEBESTEST""}, {""Title"": ""One of those films where complexities take the precedence"", ""Rating"": ""9"", ""Review Content"": ""I'm quite frustrated seeing all the pessimism surrounding this film, and I feel pity for those who have misinterpreted the message. Being a responsible reviewer as well as a fellow admirer of this wonderful medium; I would like to present my side of the argument.\n\nHear me out, let me explain...\n\n\""Gehraiyaan\"" is a tale of flawed individuals more than anything else, like a bare exhibition of human relationships. Be it parenthood, sisterhood, or romantic affectations; Gehraiyaan takes on the mantle of showcasing all these different dynamics and the social stigmas that comes alongside.\n\nThis certainly isn't glorifying infidelity nor does it set out to rationalize the characters and their iniquities; the way I see it, the film did the exact opposite! Batra's narration depicted the bad choices and the consequences that followed. Amongst this pair of individuals, nobody was perfect, they all had flaws just like everyone else does as human beings. And \""Gehraiyaan\"" with its innate dissertation attempted to illustrate the painful reality we all want to run away from.\n\nWhile on one hand, it very much instigates the feel of salvation, favours the idea of moving on; on the other, it gets to a relatively different verdict, where it exemplifies the fact (the last scene with that Old Lady), that no matter how hard we try to get over our sins, the past will always catch up. The memories will haunt our thoughts till the end of time.\n\nAlthough, I do understand that many people might find these intricacies, a bit difficult to comprehend. Therefore, let's just put aside the narrative for a moment and let us all cordially appreciate how invigorating the presentation is on a technical level. I simply adore the visuals. The roaring waves of the sea symbolised the endless rifts in our conscience, So articulated, isn't it? The same goes for Music! I became infatuated with the composition. It not only intensified the very essence of dramatic portions but also set the right kind of mood and ambience the film otherwise insisted on.\n\nNow, on the subject of performances, the entire ensemble poured their hearts out. It seems the majority of the audience is only interested in the contours of intimacy but not the rationales behind the same. I don't know the problem people have with Deepika Padukone, nor do I care, but nobody in their sane minds could deny the capacity she holds as an actor. Yet again, What an astonishing performance, Deepika for me was unmatched, unparalleled in here.\n\nSiddhant Chaturvedi is another highlight. Since the announcement, all eyes were on him, we all expected him to deliver and let me just say, he doesn't disappoint. Ananya Pandey had gone through a lot of complaints and disapprovals down the years. Perhaps a bit too much at times.\n\nNot me though, as I have always been a well-wisher, and I knew that with a little bit of guidance and under a competent director, she would do well. And guess what? She has made some progress. Dhairya Karwa as Karan is perhaps the weakest link of this feature, although it's not entirely his fault as the writing on his part hasn't been up to the mark as compared with what others have gotten!\n\nAt long last, we've reached the part where I normally draw a conclusion. But before I do that, I hope, I was able to clear all your doubts, if not, have it your way, do as you please. Then you have to come to terms with the fact that maybe it's not made for you. \""Gehraiyaan\"" is one of those films, where complexities have the upper hand.

That she was able to turn her horrific adolescence into a brilliant success speaks greatly to her character, despite the monstrous influence of this horrible, pathetic man.\n\nShe eventually finds herself forced into a life she'd never imagined; having children, forced into exotic dancing and prostitution- surrounded at every turn by devastation and depression.\n\nSo many people refused to give up, refused to let her fade into obscurity. An author, a retired FBI agent, and an incredibly brilliant group of DNA genealogists combined forces to finally give this girl the name and proper headstone she deserved, in spite of the monster who'd taken it upon himself to destroy her, her son, and their lives.\n\nThis story is so wonderfully done and pays tribute to a brilliant star in the sky who was never able to realize the power of her shine. What a complete and total tragedy that befell this child, and it's an honorable group of people that ultimately ensured her death would not be the end of who she was.

After carefully building the tension so that darkness falls with a murderer on the loose... the audience is taken back to the start again. It completely ruins the momentum of the film.

Having said that, also do not think that it will pull punches or refrain from showing skin. But it has to be earned - it has to make sense. It is the game, the playfulness, the serious talk, the getting to know each other ... before it makes sense to fully bare oneself - pun intended.\n\nAnd as we get to know the people - we do root for them in a weird sense. Because we know this is an arrangement. This is not your usual love story, where you expect the main characters to end up together in the end. Even so, certain things happen that will shock you to a degree. Because while this is light and funny ... it also provides us with a darker side. There is drama - and that feels necessary too.\n\nWe are all humans, we all have needs. Maybe we should not shame each other - especially those who try to explore them. Everyone has different needs and wants - and everyone goes on different about obtaining them. Just remember: life is precious and time is even more precious. Make the most of it - sounds cliche, but if you get something out of this, hopefully it is the positive messages it sends out.

Seriously? This film lacks truth and spews the same clichéd baloney Pretty Woman did over 30 years ago, and this film is just as offensive.\n\nJust like Gere's character in Pretty Woman, Thompson's character is white, upper-class and uses a posh, expensive hotel suite as her sexual playground. The filmmakers invoke the female gaze through the depiction of the male character as perfectly toned, without body hair, and six-pack abs much like Julia Roberts' character who was depicted with a perfect body to the point in which a leg model was used as a body double to appeal to the male gaze.\n\nDespite living through the sexual revolution, the proliferation for sex-tip articles in glamour magazines, and HBO series such as Hung and Sex in the City, Thompson's character is a sexually naïve and clueless woman unable to find her own clitoris.\n\nHowever, the Big Lion prostitute is kind, funny, confident, and STD-free - like most well-educated and emotionally secure prostitutes.

Don't be foolish and think that, because this is an adaptation of the book more than anything. This movie took some creative liberties, some really good creative liberties, in fact. The movie is set during World War II, in an Italy under Mussolini. War plays a huge role in this film, and I think Del Toro did a good job of taking the basic ideas from the original story, and expanding on them. For example, a certain island setting from the original story is not present in this film, but in its place is a genius substitute that serves practically the same kind of purpose in a way. Every character is interesting and the worlds are very dense with details. While having a dark tone, the movie also finds a way to be upbeat and charming at times. Also, the music is great, the musical songs are pleasing to the ear. Best of all, the visuals are stunning, the puppets capture emotion even though they're puppets. This movie beats Disney's remake by a long shot, and I hope it gets lots of credit for that. Watch this movie if you like the story of Pinocchio, but expect differences and a darker tone.

It also made me laugh and cry and lay back in awe in my theater - feel lucky if you get a chance to go see theatrical and don't pass it up if you can - at one of the great stop motion animations of my lifetime.\n\nI'm sure there are little complaints or nitpicks I can have - ie as strong and believable and emotional an actor Gregory Mann is for the regular scenes, he's slightly one note as a singer for me. But they mostly pale in this giant work of a vision that is collaborative (Jim Henson productions Co produced and I'd love to know if any of this was puppeteers not just with the stop-motion 24fps), yet del Toro's voice and mind and vision is very potent and daring; that of creating a story of Disobedience in the face of the Big Paternal thing of a Fascistic leaders and so called fathers, and a fairy tale in an Iconoclastic approach (meaning as he said at a q&a it doesn't tell you to obey your parents so you'll be a good boy, it says you should be and think for yourself).\n\nGDT's Pinocchio is a wonderful hot chocolate that deals with parental grief; why Gepetto creates Pinocchio is a prologue that makes this a film as much about him as the title character and what he has to learn.

GDT is past his prime."", ""Rating"": ""4"", ""Review Content"": ""4* out of 10*\n\nAfter watching GDT's latest work \""Pinocchio\"" I went online to see if people were as disappointed as I was. Surprisingly, I couldn't find a single professional review that didn't applaud the film as a wonderful masterpiece. If movie critics don't have the balls to say it, I will: GDT has lost his mojo. What started to show in the mediocre and over-hyped Shape of Water and became even more apparent in the over-long and lacklustre Nightmare Alley is obvious after Pinocchio: GDT is not a very talented storyteller - and subtlety is NOT his strong suit. None of the two mentioned earlier films caught me on an emotional level and Pinocchio also completely failed to do so. It felt a bit like it's main character: wooden and without a true heart.\n\nThe film might look brilliant on a technical level but even the optical surface lacks heart. I was surprised that supposedly this was all stop-motion, because it felt like CGI all the way. I don't know what it was exactly but the film simply looks too perfect. The characters and scenery never come across like puppets, everything feels animated. Even if they put in years of handy work, I am sure they glossed over all the frames digitally and enhanced the images.\n\nThe first twenty minutes of the film were great and showed GDT's potential. However, as soon as Pinocchio showed up, it all went down the drain. If the film's biggest weakness is its main character, you have a problem. I did not like the design and looks of Pinocchio, at all. He looks creepy. Plus, the dude is a completely obnoxious jack-ass who is super-annoying. His voice was particularly bothersome. How are we supposed to root for him? I knew it was over when he started to sing his first song and my ears started bleeding. That song made absolutely no sense. Pino knows perfect English and knows all the words, until he doesn't when the song need him to.\n\nWhy was this a musical anyway? Every single song was terrible and the lyrics were so bad. The music added nothing to the narrative but catapulted me right out of the film, as I had to resist the urge to fast forward whenever they started singing.\n\nThe film generally drags a lot and could and should have easily been cut about 30 minutes. It struggles to find its tone and therefore its audience. Is it aimed at children? Too dark and all over the place. At adults? Not really dark and emotional enough and too childish.\n\nAnother major flaw is the over-bloated, weak script. The story is messy and all over the place. GDT shoves so many narrative threads and sceneries into the film that it completely loses fo-cus and fails to tell a cohesive story. There is the church theme, the carnival, the war camp (?), the Mussolini thread, the fish monster part, the other-world-hell narrative - it's just too much. All these disjointed scenes sure try to bring across a message. And they do so VERY heavy-handed. As I said, subtlety is not GDT strong suit. For example, we all know that war is horrifying and fascism is evil. However, both these topics were handled way better in GDT's early (and ONLY) masterpiece Pan's Labyrinth. This time around, he just crams these things into the film without saying anything new about them. He just shows them and spells them out. The terror of Mussolini's fascist regime is never felt.\n\nUnfortunately, everything is literally spelled out in this film. Be who you are, don't try to be someone else. Don't project your dead son into a puppet. Religion is dumb. War is terrible. Let go, don't lose yourself in grief. Immortality is worse than dying. Lying is bad but sometimes, when it gets you somewhere, it's fine (??).\n\nOne gets the impression that either, GDT doesn't truly care about his messages or he simply doesn't have the narrative capacity to convey them in a convincing manner. He kind of picks them up, looks at them, briefly shows them to us and then drops them to pick up the next shiny idea he finds on the ground. For the viewers, this is unsatisfying and left me feeling stale.\n\nOne cannot help but have the impression that GDT only truly cares about himself and showing off all he has accomplished while neglecting careful story-telling. This can best be seen by the fact, that he puts his name in front of the movie title. A thing, film-makers typically do once they are past their prime. GDT marvels in the glory of his own name and the technical flex of the animation. This hubris culminates in the casting of friggin Cate Blanchett - only to have her voice a darn monkey without a single word of dialogue.\n\nThe Scottish cricket voiced by McGregor is tasked with watching over Pinocchio and providing him moral guidance to become a good boy, which is set-up big time in the beginning. I have never seen a character fail more miserably at their quest. He does not once guide the guy or even speak to him much during the film, for that matter. In the end, he goes like \""Yeah, I did my best, that's all you can ask of me.\"" and is granted his one wish.\n\nI did like Mr. Filch as Geppetto, though, he did a fantastic job! Swinton and Pearlman did al-right, too.\n\nAll in all, a pretty big disappointment."", ""Upvotes"": ""93"", ""Downvotes"": ""75"", ""Reviewer"": ""phizzle21""}]"

Stop there and thank me later."", ""Rating"": ""1"", ""Review Content"": ""The first Hellraiser was historic and marked a new era in horror movies. The film made Clive Barker a household name. The legendary author Stephen King having remarked, \""I have seen the future of horror. His name is Clive Barker\"".\n\nBut after this and a few cult horror offerings like Nightbreed and Lord Of Illusions, Barker has since disappeared into obscurity. Hellraiser remains my favorite Cliver Barker horror film because of his first attempt at directing a horror film by himself. The transition from writer to director is not easy and very difficult. Barker proved his critics wrong. Hellraiser was a resounding success and spawned subsequent sequels. In my opinion, only the first four Hellraiser films are coherent and worth watching. They make a complete quadrilogy.\n\nHellraiser was the first film to incorporate Cenobites, referred to as, \""demons to some, angels to others\"". The head Cenobite was a character called Pinhead, his name derived from his bald head studded with nails. He was played by actor Doug Bradley, whose acting and voice-acting of Pinhead in particular I'm very fond of. Doug tried to appear in as many Hellraiser sequels - but not all. Without his great contribution, Hellraiser would have no roots at all.\n\nBack to this film. All Hellraiser films deal with the opening of a puzzle box(like Pandora's box) and unleashing hell(the Cenobites). This one follows the same pattern. A collector Roland Voight acquires the puzzle box(also called the Lemarchand Configuration, created by the French toymaker Philip Lemarchand for Duc de L'Isle an occultist). The story of the origin of the box is shown in Hellraiser part 4 called Hellraiser: Bloodlines. Voight tells a sex worker called Joey to solve the box. Joey solves the configuration and is stabbed by a blade hidden inside the box. A portal opens, from which chains fly out and rip Joey apart, as Voight demands an audience with Leviathan.\n\nSix years later, recovering addict Riley is living with her brother Matt, his boyfriend Colin, and their roommate Nora. Riley's boyfriend, Trevor, convinces her to help break into an abandoned storage warehouse, where they discover the puzzle box. Returning home late, Riley gets into an argument with Matt and leaves. At an empty park, she solves the box but avoids being cut by the blade. The Cenobites, a group of deformed humanoids, appear and demand she choose another as sacrifice. Matt finds Riley blacked out and, as he tries to wake her up, inadvertently cuts himself on the box. He goes to a nearby restroom to clean his wound. Riley hears him scream and discovers that he has vanished. The rest of the film deals with Riley's quest to find her missing brother.\n\nVerdict: if you've seen the first four films, don't expect good acting like the previous installments. The actors are soulless(pun intended), talent-less and inexperienced. There is no notable veteran among the lot of them. Doug Bradley could have been given a role in this film. The special effects are okay but not outstanding given today's overuse of C. G. I. Photography is above average and the background sound-effects are decent. The director tries to make the best with the script given to him. I don't blame the director but the people who conceived the idea of this bland reboot.\n\nMore Clive Barker films: Underworld 1985(directed by George Pavlou), Rawhead Rex 1986(also directed by George Pavlou), Candyman 1992(directed by Bernard Rose), The Midnight Meat Train 2008(directed by Ryuhei Kitamura), Book of Blood 2009(directed by John Harrison).\n\nThanks for reading this review!"", ""Upvotes"": ""163"", ""Downvotes"": ""110"", ""Reviewer"": ""Vivekmaru45""}, {""Title"": ""What is this?"", ""Rating"": ""1"", ""Review Content"": ""I've been seeing a lot of positive reviews on this film and thought I'd give it a watch but did I just watch the same film some of the critics have watched?\n\nThis film is abysmal, it's cheap looking, poorly acted, boring as hell.\n\nThe make up effects on the new Pinhead are awful, it just doesn't look right at all, there's too many pins crammed into the face of the actress and it almost looks like a cosplay outfit.\n\nThere are some pretty neat looking practical effects in this one although there are some awful ones as well, it is gory but then you'd expect that from a Hellraiser movie, it's dark and broody but some of the scenes are so dark you can barely make out what's going on.

Trevor convinces Riley to accompany him to an abandoned warehouse that supposedly holds an abandoned and forgotten shipment belonging to some billionaire, but once they get there the shipment turns out to be a puzzle box whose value Trevor is dubious of. After Riley comes home drunk once again Matt angrily tells her to leave and she does so taking the puzzle box with her and inadvertently opening the box and summoning demonic creatures known as cenobites. As Riley did not cut herself on the box as she was intended to, the Cenobites demand \""another\"" and when a now called Matt attempts to come to Riley's aid he cuts himself on the box and is taken by the cenobites. Riley attempts to track down the origins of the box and a way to bring back Matt which leads her to the box's previous now deceased owner Roland Voight (Goran Visnijic), a ruthless businessman with legendarily sadistic appetites as the box continues to claim more victims.\n\nFollowing the release of Hellraiser: Bloodline, Clive Barker remained uninvolved with the series as it continued in a streak of direct-to-video installments legendarily known for taking unrelated scripts and reverse engineering them by inserting Pinhead. Barker announced in 2006 following the release of Hellworld his intent on remaking the series with rightsholder Dimension films. The remake went through a revolving door of directors and writers to the point that two obligation sequels, 2011's Hellraiser: Revelations and 2018's Hellraiser: Judgment were rushed into production just so Dimension wouldn't relinquish the rights. Following the collapse of the Dimesnion's parent company The Weinstein Company, Spyglass Media acquired the remake rights with Barker producing alongside David S. Goyer who would write the initial treatment. David Brucker, director of well regarded horror films The Ritual and The Night House became attached to direct with Bruckner's writers on Night House Ben Collins and Luke Piotrowski coming aboard as well. Now dropping on Hulu just in time for Halloween, Hellraiser breathes new life into this long neglected franchise and makes it the best incarnation we've seen since at least Hellbound: Hellraiser II.\n\nOdessa A'Zion is really solid in the lead role of Riley and while the character is a little abrasive upon first introduction, I feel the movie really understands that cycle of addiction that becomes hard to break out of and Riley's addiction is a massive part of what makes this movie work as it's well integrated with the Hellraiser Iconography as Riley's obsession and repeated usage of the Lament Configuration much like her addiction leads to pain and suffering of those around her be they casual contacts, friends, or loved ones and while Riley doesn't want to hurt anyone, her drive to find her brother follows the same mindset in finding her next \""fix\"" where she finds herself indifferent or uncaring of the consequences and only able to focus on that immediate gratification of her obsessive drive. Jamie Clayton takes on the mantle of Doug Bradley in the role of Pinhead (aka The Priest) and Clayton is phenomenal in the role as she captures the cold look and feel we associate with the character but is still allowed to make it her own.\n\nThe art direction in this movie is fantastic. While the original Hellraiser's cenobites have ingrained themselves in popular consciousness for good reason with distinct looks, this new Hellraiser keeps the same general idea of the Cenobites but goes some unique directions. For one thing unlike the original Cenobites who sported dark black leather attire, the only thing on the Cenobites this time around is skin, but the skin has been mangled, mutilated, and twisted so it's now arranged similar to the outfits of the original film but it's a nice way of giving visual distinction, so it doesn't just copy the aesthetics of the original film. The movie also features a wonderfully designed manor house belonging to Roland Voight and it's a sight to behold as it is based heavily around the designs of the Lament Configuration and is wonderfully used in the climax. The one thing that keeps this movie from being as good as the first Hellraiser in my opinion is in its usage of the character of Roland Voight. While Voight is given a great introduction in the opening sequence, he's unfortunately absent for a good chunk of the movie and this does a disservice to the film in my opinion because it forces Pinhead to take more of a role in the antagonist part of the story than should be necessary. Now it doesn't go to the level of Hellraiser III where it jumped off a cliff and made Pinhead a borderline Freddy Kruger clone, but the best Hellraiser films keep Pinhead in a supporting capacity and they mostly do that here but not as much as they should. Personally I feel the movie would've benefitted from seeing Voight as much as we saw Frank Cotton in the original film, but it's not a deal breaker and Pinhead isn't made the made antagonist so the movie does understand where Pinhead's role in this story should be.\n\nHellraiser is a welcome reboot of this legacied horror series and is easily my second favorite of this series behind the original. Anchored with strong performances by A'zion and Clayton, the movie gives you everything you want from a Hellraiser story with some disgustingly good Cenobite designs and kill sequences along with truly epic sequences that feel like expansions on the Hellbound environments. While Goran Visnjic is good as Voight, I feel he is underutilized, and the movie could've been improved from having him be a more prominent part of the story.

It's a lot of fun, exciting, has a good amount of energy, has the right amount of horror to not put the kids off it and just makes you smile. So I was glad to see that the love for it gave birth to a long awaited sequel.\n\nWith the excitement comes the caution as sequels from 80's or 90's originals have a low success rate. But like with something like 'Top Gun: Maverick' I knew that in the right hands if they committed to the concept rather than try and make it contemporary to keep the interest of modern audiences, then this could be as fun as the original.\n\nThere is a promising start that will certainly engage the fans of the original and while the structure as a whole is very familiar, it still never felt like cash grab. There was enough to keep the story going while paying homage to its predecessor which is fine as that is the reason why this film finally exists.\n\nThe action isn't really as physical as before. But as a few of our stars are a bit seasoned now, some of the changes that they made to accommodate that never made the film drag for me.\n\nThe finale is certainly the film's high point as there is one moment that will get the fans emotional. It certainly caught me off guard. It left me very satisfied, and I think it will get a strong positive response with other loyal members of the fandom also.\n\nSeeing the trio of Bette Midler, Kathy Najimy and Sarah Jessica Parker was just great. They have not lost their touch or chemistry and Midler in particular can still put on a great show. It never felt they were phoning it in. It felt like they wanted to give something back to the fans which was wholly satisfying. It was also great seeing Doug Jones return. Jones is someone that does not get enough credit from people outside of the industry. You probably don't realise how much work Jones has done and his signature physical acting was put to good use once again.\n\nAs for the new cast, they weren't as instantly likable as the ones from the original. But they did a perfectly functional job to help the story move along and were thankfully never annoying.\n\nIt was great seeing parts of the original locations used and bringing back John Debney for that memorable score to be put to use once again. Some parts did look a bit too polished, too much like a set and never felt as dirty or authentic as its predecessor. The pacing is solid but could have been a bit more rampant to give it some adrenaline. The slightly longer running time doesn't help.\n\nOther minor negatives to speak of was that the stakes never felt that big or consequential. I'm not totally surprised at this as Disney don't try to make things too scary or risky these days.\n\nBut that being said, the fun factor and energy is still there and despite its flaws I had a blast watching this. As a fan, it was great to see the gang bang together. While some of the nods, call backs and gags didn't all work, they largely were well executed. For non-fans, I feel this will remain a pleasurable watch. It does a good job celebrating its legacy and never tarnishing it. The emotional and highly satisfying finale proved that they were basically saying thank you to the fans for celebrating the original for so long.\n\nI really hope I'm not the minority as I try to avoid seeing beloved projects through tinted eyes. But I think as a film it's perfectly fine with some nice moments that anyone can be invested in. But this will clearly satisfy the fans.\n\nI must mention that there is a post credits scene.

There is nothing wrong with delivering exactly what's expected for kids' movies. It's a bit bewildering that so many fall short. This is the fourth (and final) film in the hugely successful \""Transylvania\"" animated movie franchise, although it's the first not directed by Genndy Tartakovsky (credited here as co-writer and Executive Producer). Also missing this time are Adam Sandler and Kevin James, who previously voiced Dracula and Frankenstein, respectively. The character voices have been replaced by Brian Hull and Brad Abrell, and rest assured, the vast majority of young fans will never notice. The film is co-directed by Derek Drymon (one of the creative forces behind the 'SpongeBob SquarePants' franchise - including video games and movies) and Jennifer Kluska (the main director in the 'Wild Kratts' series). What they've done is deliver exactly what's expected ... a fun time for kids.\n\nIt's been 10 years since the first HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA (2012) and nearly four years since the most recent, HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA 3: SUMMER VACATION (2018). As this one begins, Dracula is throwing a party to celebrate the hotel's 125th anniversary. It opens with Dracula and his daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez) dancing to \""Just the Two of Us\"". The sweet moment soon morphs into \""Just the Three of Us\"" as her husband Johnny (Andy Samberg) joins in. This is the first, but certainly not the last, transformation - as you've probably guessed by the title.\n\nThe characters and visuals are the key elements for most kids, and 'Transylvania' is here to serve. What's interesting this time is that Johnny and Mavis are the key players. Thanks to a special ray gun that transforms (there's that word again) humans to monsters and monsters to humans, the big kick here is that Johnny is zapped and becomes a colorful and zany dragon that is sure to generate laughs. Cellar-bound Van Helsing (a returning Jim Gaffigan) is the developer of the ray gun. After a series of mishaps result with the party punch turning most of the monsters into human form, the whole crew sets off on a South American adventure to locate a replacement crystal so the ray gun can return them to their natural monster state.\n\nSince most kids' movies include a life lesson or moral, you can probably guess what happens to the characters on that journey. Being transformed gives them a different perspective and appreciation of the \""other\"" side. That said, the comedy here leans towards the slapstick and pratfalls of classic cartoons, especially Looney Toons. Kids are sure to enjoy the 'physical' comedy, in particular that of Johnny as an eager-to-please dragon.\n\nMany of the voices are returning actors, and include Fran Drescher (Eunice, the Bride of Frankenstein), Steve Buscemi (Wayne the Werewolf), David Spade (Griffin the Invisible Man), and Keegan-Michael Key (Murray the Mummy). There is a humorous recurring gag for grown-ups with Frankenstein and how much he admires his human looks, a startling visual of BB the guinea pig, and a reminder of why momma always told you to keep an eye on your drink at parties.

Although the usual cliches like a cocky antagonist Kermit Wilts (Minnesota Timberwolves teammate Anthony Edwards) and a dismissive owner Vince Merrick (Ben Foster) are there, Sandler, eschewing his usual over-the-top comic shtick, gives warmth and sincerity (he loves basketball anyway) to make the challenges believable and him a hero.\n\nJust look at the sweet meet between Stanley's family and Bo's to see how deftly director Jeremiah Zugar (from South Philly) swings from a saccharine take to a modest, loving union of people who understand the unifying nature of Bo and Stanley's ambition. After seeing Sandler in his tour de force Uncut Gems (Also Netflix), I am a Sandler fan who believes Sandler has moved almost instantaneously from comic to dramatic (well, maybe that fast if you consider his performance in Punch Drunk Love).\n\nIf you're young an unimpressed with my praise, perhaps these ingredients will help you to tune it in: Multiple cameos of other NBA stars, LeBron James a producer, and gritty, electric streetball games; the use of social media to get the attention of indifferent NBA bigwigs.

As a sports fan and movie fan, I approach every sports movie with trepidation and low expectations. Let's face it, most actors aren't great (or even good) athletes, and most athletes aren't great (or even good) actors. We would have no interest in a western where the cowboys can't ride horses, just as we have no interest in watching John Goodman portray a baseball legend in THE BABE (1992). I tell you this to convey my state of mind while preparing to watch this basketball movie from director Jeremiah Zagar and co-writers Will Fetters (A STAR IS BORN, 2018) and Taylor Materne. It gives me pleasure to say that even though the premise is kind of similar to Kevin Bacon's 1992 film, THE AIR UP THERE, this one should satisfy most sports and basketball fans.\n\nAdam Sandler stars as Stanley Sugermen, a long-time scout for the Philadelphia 76'ers. An opening montage gives us a taste of why he's worn out and beaten down after so many years on the road. Rushing to catch flights, too many fast-food meals, crashing in one hotel after another, and chasing down tips on the next great player ... it all adds up to frustration and too much time away from his wife Teresa (Queen Latifah) and teenage daughter (Jordan Hull). Feeling unappreciated and questioning his professional future, Stanley is ecstatic when the long-time Sixers owner played by (Oscar winner) Robert Duvall promotes Stanley to assistant coach. Unfortunately, the dream-come-true turns into a nightmare when the beloved owner dies, leaving his cocky son Vince (Ben Foster) in charge of the team. Vince has little respect for Stanley and promptly sends him back on the road.\n\nIt's in Mallorca, Spain where Stanley stumbles on a nighttime game at a local outdoor court. Immediately catching his eye is an intense, lanky player in work boots. NBA player Juancho Hernangomez stars as Bo Cruz, a true previously undiscovered diamond in the rough. The dream of all scouts is to be the first to find a transcendent player, and once they hear the NBA minimum salary, Bo's mother and young daughter are on board with Stanley taking Bo to the United States. Of course, things don't go according to plan. Vince rejects Bo, and a history of anger issues comes back to haunt Bo. Stanley ignores the naysayers, trusts his instincts, and takes on the project of preparing Bo for the scouting combine. The training montage is very well done, as Sandler and Juancho are both believable and draw us in for support.\n\nCinematographer Zak Mulligan and director Zagar deserve credit for filming the basketball sequences in a style that highlights the athletic talent without resorting to cheap editing tricks. Of course it helps that the basketball sequences are loaded with actual NBA players and playground legends. These guys look like they can play because they CAN. I'll leave the closing credit montage to highlight most of those involved, but a couple of standouts include Boban Marjonovich and Anthony Edwards, the latter playing Bo's head-game nemesis, Kermit Wilts. Also making appearances are Kenny Smith as a player agent, and the great Julius \""Dr J\"" Erving, who has a couple of scenes.\n\nWhen most people think of Adam Sandler, his long list of sophomoric and absurd man-child movies come to mind. Certainly, he can't be blamed for giving the masses what they want. It's made him a very rich man. However, his talent in more dramatic roles should not be ignored. The recent UNCUT GEMS and THE MEYEROWITZ STORIES are examples, and going back further, his turn in PUNCH DRUNK LOVE remains one of his best. As Stanley Sugermen, Sandler injects humor into his love of basketball, tossing in a couple of 'soccer' and 'geezer' jokes.

It all happens in the first three minutes. Peter gets dumped by Anne, and Emma gets dumped by Noah. We haven't even had a chance to form any opinions of these two long-term relationships, and just like that ... they are both kaput. Director Jason Orley and screenwriters (LOVE, SIMON collaborators) Isaac Aptaker and Elizabeth Berger toss us a curveball by having the dumpees form an alliance to help the other win back their dumpers. It's an unconventional approach in this genre and it works due to some sharp writing, and the extraordinary comic timing of the two leads.\n\nNice guy Peter (Charlie Day, \""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\"") loves kids, loves the elderly, and loves Anne (Gina Rodriguez, ANNIHILATION, 2018). She abruptly dumps him because he's a bit boring and she wants a \""bigger life\"" ... her dream is to be a Broadway star. Peter is crushed when she dumps him. Emma (Jenny Slate, OBVIOUS CHILD, 2014) works as a receptionist at an orthodontist office, and Noah (Scott Eastwood, THE OUTPOST, 2019) appreciates her humor, but is turned off by her lack of career ambition. Mind you, he's a fitness trainer. Emma is crushed when she dumps him.\n\nPeter and Emma have a sobbing meet-cute in the stairwell of the office building where they both work, and soon, drunk karaoke and lots of alcohol lead to quite an intricate scheme. Emma will seduce Anne's new boyfriend Logan (Manny Jacinto), while Peter will befriend Noah and talk him out of love with new girlfriend Ginny (Clark Backo). The expected results find the appropriate exes crawling back into familiar arms. It's a plan seemingly doomed to failure, but certain to provide many opportunities for laughter.\n\nThe scenes featuring Charlie Day and Jenny Slate are easily the film's best. These are two talented and funny actors who play off each other beautifully. Of course, we presume to know where all of this is headed, and it may involve a threesome and a balcony jump into a hot tub ... or it may not. The concept of sabotaging someone else's happiness in hopes they will return to you is a bit psychotic to say the least. But it's all handled with kid gloves and plays off the old adage, \""misery loves company.\"" A bit of truth and relatability occurs as both Emma and Peter dread the idea of starting over in love - a quite common dread. The film kicks off with Jimmy Durante singing \""The Glory of Love\"", and though you'll likely laugh a few times, you'll likely notice the lack of glory in the behavior of Emma and Peter.\n\nExclusively on Amazon Prime Video February 11, 2022."", ""Upvotes"": ""36"", ""Downvotes"": ""15"", ""Reviewer"": ""ferguson-6""}, {""Title"": ""Funny and cute"", ""Rating"": ""8"", ""Review Content"": ""This is one of the best rom coms I've seen in a long time.

However, it's hard to give that much credit, since even those are sloppily executed.

I won't spoil the film but if you like jackass you'll like this, if you like stupid pranks or stunts on YouTube you'll like this, if you come in expecting anything different then you are the problem.\n\nAs deep as it sounds jackass is a message of a bygone era where stuff was stupid, dangerous and care free, not sterile and woke, they don't care about race or religion they'll smack you in the nuts.

It turns out pretty far.\n\nThe movie has prolific nudity like we have never seen before from this series.

You have a cast of sympathetic goofballs and film them as they do dangerous stunts or outrageous pranks.\n\nThe humor is right out of a Looney Tuney cartoon. You want to see them flying through the air, crashing to the ground, you want to see them get hurt, but you also want to see them get back up again, uninjured and laughing.\n\nAlmost all young men do stupid and risky things in their youth. Even if they don't, they still think about doing it. Riding a shopping car off a roof into bushes, doing skateboard stunts, putting rockets on your rollerskates... we all did it one way or another.\n\nJackass Forever, sadly, does away with most of the stunts, and instead goes for the cheapest of laughs: nudity and nutshots. 90% of the \""stunts\"" in this one involve someone getting hit in the nuts by something. A boxer, a spring loaded shoe, a swarm of bees, a snake, a softball.. it gets old really fast. When it's not a nutshot, it's someone getting electrocuted. Yawn.\n\nWhat is the point of hiring younger costars, if you no loner perform stunts? Although Bam Margera became a bit obnoxious as time went on, his manic energy is still missed. This episode is restricted to the LA area, with wild ideas like skateboarding through Tokyo in Bunny costumes or the old people all but missing. Yes, Covid probably made doing that harder, and since the first Jackass movies, it's become harder to do public pranks, since most Western nations have become police states, but for much of its runtime, this film feels incredibly tame and restricted. Lots of penis and little else.\n\nThe new cast.. meh. Their comedic timing is a hit and miss and most don't feel genuine. I don't see them carrying the concept. Jackass was a 90s MTV, Beavis and Butthead generation thing, an outgrowth of laissez-faire parenting and a society that was bored with its own prosperity to the point where young men were desperate for excitement. That time has passed. Nowadays, kids grow up overprotected. Most don't know what it feels like to get into a fight, to punch someone or get punched. And if anyone even dares to do any kind of stunt, they are instantly punished. Skateboarding? Banned almost everywhere. A Bart Simpson skateboarding home from school, slaloming between pedestrians would be unthinkable today. Heck, riding a bike without a helmet will get you tackled and beaten to a pulp by police - for your own safety of course. Bottom line: Jackass was the product of a free society. That's gone forever.\n\nThat's why no passing of the torch will work. Younger people just don't remember what being free was like - because they weren't there.\n\nThe cast are still having fun, and they all get their moment to shine. But the best thing about the movie, sadly, is the ending credits, when they show clips from the old movies and MTW show. When the best thing about your movie is the credit roll, then you know it's time to call it curtains.

Even the topic of sex determination during pregnancy isn't new for us, but yes, it's true that we don't use this topic regularly in cinema. There are many episodes of the same in TV serials like Crime Petrol and Savdhaan India because they are inspired by true events. In films, you need entertainment, and maybe that's the main reason why many filmmakers didn't choose this subject for a feature film. Well, from now I can say that Divyang Thakkar's Jayeshbhai Jordaar is one honest attempt, but is it enough? Not really. The film has a good concept and also manages to present it in a satirical way, but the weak writing in the second half causes an unexpected collapse.\n\nJayeshbhai Jordaar tells a story of Jayesh Patel (Ranveer Singh), who is married to Murdra (Shalini Pandey), but they haven't got an heir. Jayesh's father, Ramlal (Boman Irani), is a proud chief of the village who has male ego transmitted from his ancestors, and he wants an heir to carry forward the male legacy in the village. He forces Mudra and Jayesh to have miscarriages, not twice or thrice, but six times. Finally, they have a girl named Nisha, who turns out to be a pure firecracker. Mudra is pregnant again, but this time Jayesh has made up his mind to have a girl child, and how he battles his father and the entire male-dominated environment of his village is all that forms the rest of the story.\n\nJayeshbhai Jordaar had a good first half. It's funny and engaging for like 50 minutes and then drags in the second half, which is about 70 minutes long. The climax portion is written poorly, and that's the biggest reason behind this unexpected collapse. The film has many loops here and there, but you overlook them until the narrative looks humorous, but the last 20 minutes have so many outdated cliches that they cannot be overlooked. Divyan's writing puts a full stop to his own progress, which has failed to reach its actual potential.\n\nRanveer Singh is one of the finest actors from the young brigade of Bollywood, and he continues the good flow with this film. He is coming from a fantastic performance in 83, and Jayeshbhai Jordaar keeps the flow going for him. His accent and body language are notable, but there are shortcomings to his character that could be blamed on the writer. The second best performer in the film is none other than Boman Irani. He is flawless as Ramlal. The only truly deadly character in the film is his only. The debutant Shalini Pandey looks decent as Mudra, while her daughter Nisha, aka Jia, is hysterical. Ratna Pathak Shah has nothing new to offer and the supporting cast of Samay Raj Thakkar, Ragi Jani, Puneet Issar and others is nothing impressive.\n\nThe film has a total of four songs; one of them appears in the end credits. Firecracker is quite a fancy and foot-tapping number, which keeps the mood alive with small glimpses throughout the narrative until it appears in its full version at the end. \""Jordaar\"" comes a while in the climax portion, but it is surely the best song from the album. The other situational song, \""Dheere Dheere Seekh Jaunga,\"" bores you a little, but not fully. Jayeshbhai Jordaar has got a jordaar but the screenplay is lame. A few of the dialogues have subtle meaning, while some are not suitable for the family audience. That \""Pappi\"" (Kiss) idea is so terrible, and how horrendous it goes in the final scene is even worse.\n\nIt's not that bad a film for a debutant, but it certainly shows the faults of Divyang. Rather, it exposes them. You can't expect a family entertainer to have such kind of language and such vulgar references to prove a hard-hitting social message because they aren't used to these urban materials. It's neither a single-screen audience film nor a multiplex-driven drama; it just wanders cluelessly somewhere in between. Divyang Thakkar's idea was great, but not his execution. He lacked the directorial skills that were needed to carry this film, but before that he lacked those writing skills that could have made Jayeshbhai Jordaar a strong film on paper. Overall, it's a misjudged script that should have been checked again and again before going on the floor. Ranveer Singh and Boman Irani's performances might please you, while the film will go down in the memory lane as a half-baked product.\n\nRATING - 5/10*"", ""Upvotes"": ""27"", ""Downvotes"": ""19"", ""Reviewer"": ""SAMTHEBESTEST""}]"

I'm baffled by how little focus is on dinosaurs. And I don't just mean they are barely onscreen. The original Jurassic Park barely had any for the first hour. But everything leading up to that, the story, dialogue and themes, were all focused on dinosaurs.\n\nThat's not the case with Dominion. The majority of the storylines are tangentially related at best, completely unrelated at worst. Imagine watching Taken but Liam Neeson has to watch out for dinosaurs... that's one storyline. You could replace dinosaurs with any scary creatures and it would make little difference to the plot.\n\nOn top of that, they did a poor job of balancing so many storylines with different characters. Or maybe it's because every single one is uninteresting. And the moment when the different characters come together falls completely flat. I compare it to Stranger Things, when the stories converge and the crew is finally together, those moments are so impactful and exciting. They feel earned and elevate everything after. In Dominion, you don't feel any kind of magic.\n\nSome parts were so bad they made me cringe or roll my eyes. But that wasn't the case for the majority of the movie. So why such a harsh score? Because this movie, which is the definition of a popcorn flick here to entertain us, is unbelievably boring.

It's even sadder when you realize it's worse than what it copied in every way.\n\nAs for the dinosaur effects, at times the animatronic dinosaurs look like toys. And the CGI dinosaurs look a bit off.

From the opening island scene with the brachiosaurus to the T-Rex reveal in the rainstorm, dinosaurs were front and center in the original Jurassic Park, inspiring a sense of grandeur and awe. The dinosaurs were what mattered, and everything else was peripheral-even the plot to get off the island. We all wanted another glimpse of the T-Rex, or were anxious to discover where the raptors were lurking.\n\nSo that was the first one. Now in this sixth installment, not only are dinosaurs relegated to a commercialized product that's seen on every tv screen in the movie, but they're demoted below the humans, genetics, and even mutated locusts in terms of importance. In a two and a half hour movie, one would expect dinosaurs to fill almost half that time, and yet they pale in screen time comparison to all the human characters. Instead, the director tried to insert cameos of the legacy characters in forced interactions and honestly cringey dialogue, shifting the focus away from the real meaning in the Jurassic Park franchise-awe for dinosaurs. The wonder is now gone.\n\nI have given it six stars in respect for the franchise and the limited appearances of some of my favorite dinosaurs, but I'm sad to see that the director forgot what made Jurassic Park so special in the first place."", ""Upvotes"": ""752"", ""Downvotes"": ""124"", ""Reviewer"": ""josiahliljequist""}, {""Title"": ""Wayne Knight said it best three decades ago: We got Dodgson here, and nobody cares."", ""Rating"": ""4"", ""Review Content"": ""I don't know whether this is a fabled memory, but a few years ago I think I read an interview where director Colin Trevorrow said that the story of Dominion was always his ultimate go-to, that Jurassic World and Fallen Kingdom were the stepping stones to there (almost as if it was gathering the right build-up with characters, fan anticipation, budget, and technological advances). For every reason imaginable, I believed him. Where Fallen Kingdom ended, you had endless opportunity to explore the world with dinosaurs running amok and causing mayhem. Final shots of Fallen Kingdom included the T-Rex at a zoo, the Mosasaurus attacking surfers, a velociraptor overlooking a suburban California, and pterodactyls towering above a tourist-populated Las Vegas. It was all there; think The Lost World's San Diego epilogue but on a grander scale with more dinosaurs. Throw in the military, philosophical conversations regarding their eradication versus their survival, advance some more characters, and you have a bona fide fun summer blockbuster.\n\nThis didn't happen.\n\nNo matter what my actual opinion is of the film hereon out, I can't help but be letdown with disappointment that Trevorrow either deluded himself into believing this was the kind of conclusion that fans yearned for ala War for the Planet of the Apes (which has a much more compelling protagonist that makes it work despite its story misdirection) or J. A. Bayona pulled a Rian Johnson and put him in a corner with the concluding chapter that he had to rectify and had no actual written plan of his own. And it's not that there isn't a medium where this story doesn't work just fine. I can imagine the main plot elements being adapted from, say, a novelization or a comic series. Hell, there was even that Battle at Big Rock short that was done which could have told these elements on their own, or at the very least introduced them. Instead, they threw in extremely disjointed story bits for this final chapter that seemed to have no source of origin. They felt like they were the contrivance meant to unite our two character groups, and nothing more.\n\nDominion starts off very okay. It shows that it can slow down, have a genuine heartbeat, provide pathos for the existence of our reptilian brethren, trot the globe to see how they have integrated (or not) with our species, and reintroduce characters new and old (with possible internal conflicts) to show how they would pave their globetrotting paths. They even fix some of the poorly written aspects of Fallen Kingdom such as maturing Franklin's character, giving better use to the laser-targeting attack system, and giving Maisie a more believable backstory. All of this is supported with fantastic animatronic work and much improved CGI blending with it. I thought the visuals were mostly a knockout and supported the onscreen setups.\n\nNot only that, but Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum kindled a similar flame to their interactions in JP1 and you sat forward to watch those moments. I caught myself smiling quite a few times during those exchanges. Jeff Goldblum was especially used well as he was able to inject entertainment and comedy through his dialogue where the film otherwise was flat with on its attempts. They were not small cameo appearances and served crucial roles to the film. You buy where they are in their lives, and even though TLW and JP3 are retconned the actors clearly tapped into those experiences for their performances to accentuate their statuses.\n\nSpeaking of buy-in, I would have given this film a long leash on a lot of things they could have done or did with this movie. We hit the point where we can embrace the ridiculous in several places. Want to make Blue become Owen's pet and attack guard? Go right on ahead. Want to modernize the action and give our protagonists more ability and skill that you might see in the Fast & Furious franchise or with our human Marvel heroes? If the dinosaurs get their large share of the action as well, I'm on board (the Malta scene is a perfect example of this). Want to pay homage to the previous films as you conclude your franchise? That is what I expect. I also expect them to diversify this on a tonal level where need be as to not become too stale, and I think I was feeling that here. Hell, there is nearly a half-hour duration where not a single dinosaur is shown or brought up, and if it's in anticipation for what is to come while building character or story then I will let it play out.\n\nThe problem really arose both when the movie decided to abandon the broad, peregrinating experience and confine its setting. Dominion is the saga's epic conclusion and did not need to put on this hat. This was a major rug pull from what was anticipated, and soured itself spending an excruciatingly long time on something that left little entertainment, tension, or dinosaurs. When they do show up, the moments become a little one-note. Our good guys have plot armor such as raptors that can run at vehicle speeds but can't catch up to running characters, or when they are cornered they just get roared at or ran/flown/swam past until they find their way out of the situation, or when they know they can stand around and trust that a carnivore won't eat them because reasons. Bryce Dallas Howard got the best/most suspenseful dino encounters at this stage of the film and they actually work extremely well, but for a near 150-minute movie these are few and far between, and for this franchise you really have to sit and ask yourself if there is a chance that she won't survive any of these instances.\n\nA lot of this could have been made better if our Rexy got some great moments, but even she was backdropped and upstaged too often to matter, or when she does come on screen it seems to be a rehashed occurrence from something of old. She looked and sounded good, though. I want to restate how good the dinosaurs actually looked here, and I want to commend the visual effects departments for what they were able to do in that department. If there was a niggle I'd have here, it would probably be in the weight of the raptor movement which felt too light and jittery. That probably only makes sense in my head, but the rest looked really good. If knowing that I would have to wait 21 years after 2001's Jurassic Park III to finally get the sequel with visuals that really soar, I would gladly take it. I just wish it was with a better film, or at least with a film that I would want to rewatch over and again. Instead, this left an aftertaste that makes me want to instead go and watch Top Gun: Maverick for a fourth time. Outside of demo material, I don't even know if I will be a completionist and get this on UHD a few months down the line. Normally one shouldn't fault a film for letting their own speculation become expectation, but in this particular instance I very much believe that you can.

Jurassic World: Dominion is a soulless film, without a shred of understanding of the magic of the original. This made-for-its-own-good movie has no originality on its own terms, no respect for the fans of this once-grand dinosaur movie series, and not an ounce of artistic merit to the film genre. On top of that, this film is also dumb from start to finish and full of holes in the story. It's a good thing Trevorrow is also responsible for the screenplay and apparently spent years looking forward to this finale, because according to his own statements, he knew from the start to which end he wanted to lead the Jurassic World trilogy.\n\nThe film begins by leaving out its own story plots from the last two films. For example, how the dinosaurs were able to spread across the planet is left out, or it is assumed that you accept that this is explained via the illegal and legalized trade in the animals. The dinosaur scenes at the beginning are quite nice, but ultimately just a two-minute montage of big dinosaur scenes. The animal rescue comes across as a naive idea in the context of the film and additionally as a silly attempt at a cross-reference to the actually problematic treatment of animals in our society. The character development of Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) is just thrown at you, Owen Grady (Chris Pratt), on the other hand, is so on the mark in his already shallow and cliché-laden development that as a viewer you can definitely handle the fact that he is now foolishly riding horses, severing individual dinosaurs from their herd for \""rescue\"". Secondary characters are introduced, only to be used as vehicles for the unfolding silly story without any depth of their own. The story surrounding the characters in the Jurassic World series quickly devolves into a globe-trotting, bad James Bond knock-off with a focus on the use of firearms, car chases and silly, superficial short cons. It goes to some Arabian countries, to a stupidly hidden black market for dinosaur goods, to a reservation of the company of \""Dogson!\"". We've got Dodgson here\"" - Dodgson (Campbell Scott), who for reasons not told somehow managed to become one of the biggest tech moguls in the world. Just as somehow, by the way, he has also managed to recover the nostalgic cream can of Dennis Nedry's dinosaur DNA theft and keep it on his shelf. Their story then just jumps from action scene to action scene, where the \""heroes\"" of the story, staged in a very modern way, survive every adversity. Apart from gunshots and dinosaur attacks, they survive a plane crash, numerous accidents and explosions unharmed. This plot, which undercuts any suspense, also leads to no fear or adrenaline buildup at all around the characters, which should actually serve to help viewers identify with them. Trevorrow makes himself the king of despondency here and destroys the legacy of the original film and its two original and respectful sequels.\n\nBy the way, the motivation for the cloned girl Maisie Lockwood (Isabella Sermon) is simply thrown overboard. Yes, that's how this trilogy was planned by the would-be visionary Trevorrow. Instead of the comprehensible cloning of the lost daughter, it is now the daughter herself who clones herself. The motivation, of course, is to save the world from disease and natural disasters. Oh, no, the motivation was the desire to save one's own new self from a deadly disease from which one suffers. Or was it? Didn't Trevorrow write a scene in which it's made clear that Lockwood didn't know about her disease when she cloned herself? Well, at least Trevorrow is so self-convinced that he doesn't care about consistency in the plot even in the context of just one film. The director and filmmaker never seems to have read an ethics book either, because the cloning action is consensually presented as a moral heroic act. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) would have to perceive this as a slap in the face, but what do the philosophical underpinnings of the original matter if a film is just poured on with cool sayings and action scenes without paying attention to the plot or the development of individual highlights in the film.\n\nThe plot around the characters of the original resembles chicanery for the fans of the franchise. The dream team of Alan Grant (Sam Neil), Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) and Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), which worked so well, is suddenly a group consisting only of references to the grandiose start of the series, which becomes more insufferable, shallow and uninteresting by the minute. Their plot around the locust plague, which at least at the beginning seems like an interesting idea before it too is told into the barrel, is at least a tad better than the action movie scenes around Pratt and Howard. But again, it's overflowing with plot holes, dumb lines, and a dynamic between Grant and Sattler so unpleasant it could make you sick. Laura Dern, by the way, plays her role so badly that she makes Ellie Sattler the most unpleasant character in the film, but since her Star Wars appearance, she's been practiced at helping destroy classic franchises.\n\nBD Wong's character development, by the way, is among the dumbest in film history. From an over-motivated and morally disinterested character in Jurassic Park, to the self-convinced and morally still subterranean leader in Jurassic World, to the morally now completely disintegrated dinosaur trader from Fallen Kingdom, we now witness here a Henry Wu who at the beginning of the film is still responsible for a biblical-capitalist plague of locusts, but at the end of the film is sneaking through a cornfield like a reformed science hippie, enjoying the redemptive feeling of moral poise. Incredibly stupid.\n\nUnbelievably stupid is much else in this film as well. The overpopulation of different dinosaurs that you get to see for a few seconds attests to a lack of understanding of the magic of the original and a lack of appreciation for the genius of how the dino scenes were handled there. The sprinkling of modern wokeness is still within limits, but where it does appear it is, as you might expect, just plain silly. The waste of potential from the old films is obvious here. The Dilophosaurs are wasted, the Carnosaurs are so scary that a couple of betting-addicted dino-fight viewers just keep watching a dino-human fight while a few feet behind them the Carnosaurs wreak havoc. The Dimetrodon, which by the way are not dinosaurs, are barely shown, just as no dinosaur can be viewed even once with enough time and calm, instead they become animal horror creatures with nothing on them but brutal aggressiveness. In the end, there is yet another stupid dinosaur fight that seems like an even dumber copy of the stupid finale of the otherwise watchable first part of the Jurassic World trilogy. The T-Rex pretending to be dead is perhaps the dumbest dino scene in the entire franchise. Let's not forget that Dearing and Grady's love for their adopted daughter is so strong that they simply make the girl stand very, very close to a velociraptor at the end of the film, because Grady is, after all, friends with this primeval predator. In order to shoot such nonsense, one must have a completely narcissistic alienation from reality.... One could go on for a long time listing the numerous plotholes, stupidities and the impudent lack of understanding of what made the original so fantastic, but that would probably take readers of this review just as long as this bloated action nonsense has running time. But one thing needs to be mentioned: The recap of the plot and the outcome for the planet presented at the end of the film is over-politicized, naive, unscientific garbage that you can either laugh your head off at in cynical fashion or cry yourself to sleep in lonely despair over humanity. Dinosaurs coexisting in harmony with the rest of nature, triceratops performing their savannah march with elephants, geese flying fearlessly with pterodactyls, blue whales swimming in peace alongside a mosasaur, and herds of wild horses, mingling with other racing dinosaur herds are certainly realistic and the ultimate goal that a human race should have in the context of a specially created species extinction by genetically manipulating the evolutionary rhythm of Earth's history.\n\nAs a conclusion, it remains to mention once again that Trevorrow could impressively prove his complete lack of cinematic understanding with this film and that Star Wars: The Last Jedi now has to share the Olympus of destroyed franchises with Jurassic World: Dominion. Nothing short of a disgrace to cinema history. Tragic."", ""Upvotes"": ""332"", ""Downvotes"": ""165"", ""Reviewer"": ""patrickfilbeck""}]"

There are impressively staged set-pieces, sophisticated production design, a pan-Indian (and possibly international) plot setup, and thumping background score. But the writing, something that didn't work for me in Chapter 1, is still very superficial. In Chapter 2, Rocky (Yash, with commanding screen presence) is no longer an underdog. He has already achieved legendary levels of notoriety with his deeds, even attracting the attention of the nation's Prime Minister. Prashanth Neel is great at crafting mass moments one after the other, in quick succession. The film, as a whole, is a carefully designed collection of mass moments - with frequent interludes of mother-son sentiment and a drab romance.\n\nIn my review for Chapter 1, I'd hoped to see Srinidhi Shetty get at least a decent arc but alas, it's even worse than the first. Not only is she deemed mere entertainment for the protagonist, her only task in the film is to say the three magical words to the guy who's been holding her captive (Stockholm Syndrome max?). Okay, I get it. My bad to even think she'd have anything worthwhile to do in the film other than \""spoilers: die while pregnant\"". The mother-son flashbacks are as weird as they can get - she whines and delivers a whole massy sermon to hospital personnel when her son is battling for life. I couldn't even buy the reason for Rocky's excessive greed - it's an attempt at painting him grey alright, but it's not written well. Neel shouldn't ever attempt family dramas or rom-coms. Like, ever.\n\nSanjay Dutt's Adheera has got the look for sure, but the nature of his character is so utterly generic that he fails to rise above Chapter 1's Garuda. Raveena Tandon's PM Ramika Sen should have been the film's trump card, but the whole angle around her is played in the safest possible manner, giving Rocky a few more instances of elevation. The mass film tropes are scattered all over the place. But if you need a filmmaker to inventively visualize your action, Neel is the man you should call. Maybe, he can make a full-blown actioner (where the core focus is just on the action) without the build-ups, the monologues, or the exaggerated sentiments.

This film impresses with its variety of forms and feelings - there is a whole bunch of emotions. Rishab Shetty has the ability to cater his films to moviegoers of all class and successfully crossed that divide between indie and mainstream. Even his production 'Pedro' and which is doing wonders in the festival circuit endows his ability to strike a balance. Likewise with Rakshit Shetty who has backed so many indie films including the recent Sakutumba Sametha (2022).\n\nComing to Kantara, this film has so many layers of complexity and it's amazing Rishab expresses a lot while keeping it grounded, rooted and minimalistic. With unending sound of the biosphere set in Tulunadu as a conjunction between ecology, greed of man, civilization and everything in between sums up the tone of the film. I loved the idea of the flashback and voiceover to set things going from the start. On the other hand, this is a proper commercial film so expect all the genre troupes, elevations, guy falling head over heels in love and a story done to death. But Rishab stands out as he chooses this inalienable closeness of mother earth and man, adds the main ingredient, i.e. Is ENTERTAINMENT!\n\nEven Shiva as the rebel concept was conveyed so well, the face-off that involves internal and external conflicts will immerse you. His character is grey and not without its downsides as he lives in two worlds at the same time. The first is the world of flesh and bone, and the second is the divine, which is his true calling to carry the legacy of his father. The realization is pretty good, when he gets nightmares for the wrongdoings, he is led to this mysterious place in the forest, like a portal. It happens in the pre-climax after the brilliant \""i am cleansed,\"" scene, very short and doesn't go into full details of the transformation. The gloomy atmosphere in the film occupies a central niche, besides, the tone of that forest, it also contributes to the overall outcome of the film.\n\nThe visuals are ideally combined with subplots and the authenticity to mix the culture of Kambla and Bhootha Kola is not an overkill. It is picturized so well as the climax moments densely settles in memory for quite a long time and it will be the same for other viewers too.\n\nThe main thing here is that the spirit of Rishab Shetty to keep it authentic right from music, staging, actors and ending with costumes. It is really tough that he will have another big film comparable to Kantara in his career. To put it simply and briefly, I am delighted with the viewing. Enjoyed every minute from start to finish. A community watch, a spectacle made for only celluloid experience. I know when this will be out on OTT so called shallow cinephhiles, purists, Xenolingohassens will find it cringe and problematic.

The love story had typical harrassment scenes which were romanticized as the heroine also didn't had any problem with . The comedy was also extremely forced and cringe like i was watching some 90's comedy movie. Acting was crap in many scenes apart from the Cop and Rishabh. Many scenes were like why is it even there , no need of those scenes they were just put to cross the 2 hour mark maybe for some reason. The heroine was completely useless as i said the love story didn't contributed even a bit .\n\nEverything can't be bad surely. The climax was good ( not great for sure ) the acting was great though which elevated the scene but i have seen such performance from Dhanush already in a much grounded version named Asuran which had similar plot but was much much better than this.

As Angela digs deeper into the stream she's met with resistance from Amygdala's corporate bureaucracy who worry about tainting their going public with a scandal and must now try to overcome her trauma to find who was killed and why.\n\nKIMI marks the latest film from versatile director Steven Soderbergh and the latest original film for HBO Max following Soderbergh's previous efforts Let Them All Talk and No Sudden Move. Written and produced by noted screenwriter David Koepp, Koepp is in familiar territory having collaborated with David Fincher in 2002 on the home invasion thriller Panic Room that despite its familiar trappings won over critics and audiences with its directorial style and performances. While the movie takes a well-trodden format inspired by Hitchcock's Rear Window, Koepp gives the material a fresh spin that reminded me of the early 2000s Larry Cohen thrillers like Phone Booth and Cellular that took the emerging cell phone technology of the time and applied it to classic thriller tropes. What Larry Cohen did for Cell Phones, David Koepp does for the era of Alexa and Google Asssitant and I was honestly pretty engaged from start to finish.\n\nZoe Kravits is terrific in the role of Angela and much of the time, especially in the first hour, Angela is the only character we see directly as she interacts through the world primarily through text messaging, video conferencing, and phone calls. Kravitz does a good job of conveying a person who's suffered a past trauma and walled herself off in favor of a techological barrier that allows her to survive and work in the 21st Century, and the movie gives her a solid arc in her \""Hedgehog's Dilemma\"" where's she's protected and fortified herself but has to learn to put down defenses and trust people and the world again. Kravitz and Byron Bowers have solid chemistry in their relationship and you feel Bowers frusturation with trying to be understanding of Angela's trauma while also trying to convince her to come outside her apartment with him. In addition to Bowers, the movie also features a solid supporting cast who appear throughout including David Wain, Andy Daly, Jacob Vargas, and a host of others who help sell the scenario put on screen.\n\nSoderbergh does a great job crafting a modern day thriller whilst utilizing classic thriller tropes that can be traced to the likes of Alfred Hitchcock and Stanley Donen. While the movie does fall under the umbrella of \""Covid films\"" we've seen with the likes of higher end (relatively speaking) films like Songbird or Locked Down to direct-to-video schlock like The Covid Killer or Corona: Fear Is a Virus, KIMI is the first one I feel actually works for the type of movie it's trying to be. Many of those movies mentioned even Songbird or Locked Down which had the resources of Michael Bay and Steven Knight often felt like rushed \""strike while the Iron's hot\"" films designed to catch people with a timely premise and little else substantiating it. Soderbergh and Koepp feel like they utilize the Covid pandemic to tell a story and examine its impact upon a character, but it never feels like its timeliness is being used as a gimmick. Soderbergh brings his usually visual flair to the proceedings as he uses Steadicam when we're inside Angela's apartment, but once we're outside with Angela the filmmaking uses a handheld camera and a number of tilted shots to give a good visual sense of the tension and unease felt by Angela making for great visual storytelling. Koepp's script keeps a solid pace throughout its brisk 89 minute runtime, but you feel like you get to know the characters and the mystery quite well as we're very much placed in Angela's shoes. Admittedly the movie loses some of its tension after the hour mark when everything is \""laid out\"" but that only means it goes from being great to being good, and even if the stuff in the last third pales in comparison to the first hour, it gives a deliciously entertaining pay-off to Angela's arc with some dark as black humor in how she utilizes the Kimi. Koepp's script is also a much less pessimistic and misanthropic take on the material than I've seen with other films that attempt this kind of thing. One standout sequence I loved was when two nameless thugs in a van try to kidnap Angela and some nearby homeless rights protestors block the van from escaping and pull her out of the van and help her to safety.\n\nKIMI takes conventional thriller trappings and applies it to our modern day world without feeling like \""headlinesploitation\"".

The camera and editing move things with a surefire pace while inside that apartment, and then once outside the tilted angle walking/running angles and movements give further evidence as to why Peter Andrews takes risks and they more often than not pay off.\n\nAnd while Kravitz brings her A game to a character that requires a lot of pain and trauma and battling multiple mental illnesses and disorders, I was so impressed by the casting in the supporting roles, with Rita Wilson giving us everything to know who this woman is in less than five minutes, Ratray (you know, hes been in dozens of films and TV shows but he's always Buzz in, once again, Home Alone one and two), that one actor my wife got so excited about who was one of the leads in Jane the Virgin, and in particular Derek DelGaudio as the man who is so in deep s*** and causing all of this criming-and-paying-off in the first place (that is to say the same kind of concerned/serious countenance we got I one brilliant way in In and Of Itself is used in another in his few scenes).\n\nAnd more than many other films I can think of in the past ten or so years, the themes of omnipresent surveillance, abuse and paranoia are amplified because it's not the future; it's not only here, but worse than many other films or stories anticipated decades ago. The pandemic is the backdrop, but it doesn't feel inconsequential to what's happening here either; all this time being Inside and everything in the world, one doesn't have to go so far to imagine, furthers and worsens the anxiety and negative parts that keeps Angela inside. It's also about how some of us (maybe even the director himself) can't not pay attention to the little details if we are surrounded by the things we are familiar with day in and day out - even, for sure, tooth aches.\n\nThis isn't to say some things aren't without criticism, like how little screentime we get with erika Christenen (we do understand what her function is in the film, just more of her would've been cool), and that the movie doesn't make it seem that difficult for Angela to traverse all that outside ground once she opens the door and gets through it (maniacal tilted compositions besides), which is a trope of these kinds of movies.\n\nBut Kimi is playful and daring and keeps its feet playfully and yet seriously in the genre, and would probably make for a good painting with Soderergh's own Unsane, also about a woman under dire straits fighting her own inner conflict while powers far greater than her pull the strings. It's a minor idiosyncratic gem by a director and writer who make it seem so easy when it's definitely not.\n\n(PS: wonder if Soderbergh liked how Sabotage was used in the Star Trek movies)"", ""Upvotes"": ""44"", ""Downvotes"": ""48"", ""Reviewer"": ""Quinoa1984""}, {""Title"": ""One of the worst movies I've ever seen"", ""Rating"": ""1"", ""Review Content"": ""This is top 5 worst movie I've ever seen.

The movie is plot-heavy so the less said about how this plays out, the better.

The end.\n\nExcept... director Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre's version of the story was - according to the programme for the 2022 London Film Festival, where I saw the production - supposed to build on the character of Constance Chatterley, making her more than the voracious sexpot she is sometimes portrayed as. But even the Sylvia Kristel version gave Lady C a social conscience, and portrayed her as capable of greater things had societal expectations not condemned her to life as merely her husband's hostess. The only difference in this version is Connie is a bit stroppier.\n\nAlso, whereas previous versions have delved into Clifford Chatterley's character in an at least partially sympathetic manner, there is none of that here: as portrayed by Matthew Duckett he is chipper enough, but also the stereotyped, one-dimensional English snob (\""Why can't the working classes be grateful?\"" etc). There is no sign of the anguish most men would feel on having their ability to walk - let along have sex! - taken from them. Again, previous versions have done it better.\n\nAnd the sex scenes are not very good, either!\n\nOn the other hand, Joely Richardson's version of Mrs Bolton is an improvement on previous versions, being warm and supportive to both Connie and Clifford. This is the first non-glamorous role I have seen Richardson take on, and she is the best thing in the film.\n\nI hope anyone considering future adaptations of Lawrence's novel follows the example of many Shakespeare adaptations by keeping the basic plot but changing other things: set it further in the past, or in the future; locate it in Asia or Africa with an appropriately-ethnic cast; make it gay or lesbian.

Watch Ikiru instead, I beg you!!"", ""Rating"": ""1"", ""Review Content"": ""Honestly, I couldn't be more upset about how awful this film is. It doesn't feel like a remake, it feels like plagiarism. At the midpoint just when Nighy actually comes to life for a half second instead of being a walking corpse in need of an eternal nap, the film steals the exact same structure from Kurosawa's masterpiece Ikiru. Just when the film comes to life for literally less than one minute, it pulls the rug out and returns to being the dull, mopey, sappy, saccharine, snoozefest pabulum it's so dead set on being.\n\nThe only positive thing I can say about this movie is that if these people can get paid to make a movie as bereft of the human spirit as this film is, well then there is hope for any filmmaker out there. Because, truly so little invention went into this, it's frankly appalling.\n\nI'm appalled by all the awards and nominations being showered on this shameful act of copycatting. There isn't an ounce of creativity or artistry in this movie. How can you take Kurosawa's masterpiece, one of the greatest films in the history of cinema, and say I'm going to make a garbage Netflix movie out of it with boring shot-reverse-shot TV cutting patterns!? It's beyond the pale. And then to nominate it for Best Adapted Screenplay after they've sucked all the life out of the original, it boggles the mind!? If they just made this a streaming movie, I wouldn't have cared. Give the lazy couch surfing, iphone watching masses their pablum to slurp on. But to have the gall to put this in theatres and gussy it up as if it's a prestige movie is shameful and appalling. (Yes, I keep saying \""appalling,\"" because that's just what this is, and if Nighy can keep saying \""what a bore\"" throughout a movie that is a literal giant bore from start to finish, then I've got my own repetition license too.)\n\nFirst of all, I've been a Bill Nighy fan for as long as I can remember. And that's really the only reason I went to a theatre and bought a ticket to see this movie, and risked my life in rush hour traffic to get there. I legit almost got hit by an Uber while crossing with the right of way within the pedestrian markings because I was hustling to get to the screening. (Imagine being so full of life. I know it's hard after seeing this movie.) To think I could have ended up hospitalized for this utter tripe.\n\nNighy should have turned this down. He's a great character actor, but doesn't have the range for a lead of this caliber. (Sleeping through a major section of the story and hiding in the shadows of the bar is not an acting choice.) More to the point though is that he is no longer in the casting range to play a \""father\"" especially not a 1950's father. There was no such thing as \""old dad\"" syndrome in the '50's. And even today he is well beyond \""old dad\"" casting. He is well and fully into grandfather territory. So getting diagnosed at his age is not exactly a massive tug on the heart strings. It's well within a person's time to go, eliciting low wattage on the empathy scale.\n\nThe girl who is supposed to remind him of the vibrance of youth is as dull as they come. I know the director previously made a gay army movie and it clearly shows, as there isn't an ounce of straight sexuality in this film. Even the stripper, who in Kurosawa's film is shot in the most iconic way and immediately gets a rise out of Shimura's Watanabe. Here she is a dumpy broad left over from a Dove commercial that makes you want to look away. Hardly any reason to go on living. And Nighy's not even awake to see her. Ridiculous. And his tour guide through what is supposed to be a carnival of pleasures is just some schlub guy who has no life in him either. He also has this distractingly odd Stacey Keatch doppelgänger thing going on but, of course, with zero element of danger or intrigue to him.\n\nThis is really one of the most garbage remakes I've ever seen. It's inexcusably bad. I urge you PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE! Get a free trial to The Criterion Channel and watch IKIRU! Or find it on Kanopy, Or just rent it. Please, you must.

During a massive storm Hannah's abusive and presumed dead ex Phillip (Logan-Marshall-Green) kidnaps their daughter Vee and Hannah enlists Lou's help in tracking the two down leading to Lou tapping into her dormant skillset and long buried wounds that made her who she is.\n\nLou is the directorial debut of cinematographer Anna Forester whose previous directing credits were in television such as Criminal Minds and Outlander. Produced by J. J. Abrams' Bad Robot Productions, the film while initially setup at Paramount was dropped early on with Bad Robot opting to film Lou independently with distribution rights eventually being picked up by Netflix. The movie doesn't break too far from the established formula of this kind of action thriller, but it does deliver on suspense and character you expect from this type of film.\n\nOne of the things that stood out to me with Lou was just how gritty the film looks. While Lou is set in the 1980s, the movie wisely avoids becoming \""nostalgia porn\"" and really only uses 80s iconography or references when appropriate and in context rather than reminding you every few minutes as some films set in the decade have been guilty of. From the hard-edged fight sequences to some really tense survival sequences such as a setpiece on a lopsided rope bridge the movie reminded me of thrillers such as 1988's Shoot to Kill which mixed this kind of chase movie with environmental perils. Allison Janney is really good as Lou and her performance as this hardened isolated loner is well done and she fits the role very well in terms of both the character's backstory and skillset as well as conveying the inner turmoil of this character when it's revealed what the source is. The other actors are good in their roles too with Jurmee Smollett's performance as an abuse survivor quite engaging and Logan Marshall-Green a solidly done antagonist even if they're not as compelling as Janney's role. The movie does have a twist relating to certain character relationships and like most twists related to this type of genre exercise I think most will see it coming, but it works well enough thematically and leads to a tense and emotional climax that I was willing to let it pass.\n\nLou doesn't reinvent the wheel when it comes to this kind of gritty minimalist action thriller, but it gives enough meat to the characters, aesthetics, and performances that I was kept engaged throughout the film's brisk 100-minute runtime.

There are a lot of characters, and not enough context around any of them to bring them together into a story worth paying attention to.\n\nAnd when the story finally gets told, it's sad and disturbing, yes -- but it's not really told through a lens where the viewer can learn anything meaningful about life or humanity.

Killer artificial intelligence has been done time and time again plus adding the killer doll tropes just made it seem all the more cliche. But then the reviews came out, with critics heralding M3gan as a \""campy masterpiece\"" and \""hilarious\"" which admittedly piqued my interest. Having now seen M3gan, it's a comedy first but there's enough horror here to still qualify it for the genre. There are moments where M3gan is running down a prospective victim or doling out her varied forms of punishment that had me shuddering in my seat. Most of it is happening off screen but I was pleasantly surprised by how far the movie pushed the envelope, even if it was only implied. So while I can't call M3gan horrific or even scary, there's sufficient creepy material to qualify it for the genre still.\n\nEven though M3gan is kind of sporting the horror genre as a mask, I was mostly impressed with what the movie decided to focus its efforts on. Starting with the characters, I was surprised at how rough and awkward they made Gemma's character. This was actually a plus for me, it setup her reasons for pushing M3gan further even when it wasn't prudent to do so. She doesn't have paternal instincts and continues to be largely selfish so why not create something to do it for her? (this is obviously problematic thinking but more on that later). It also made her eventual connection with Cady more improbable yet believable. The film also points out the unhealthy nature of Cady's attachment to M3gan several times in a clinical fashion. It establishes the stakes of how Gemma's choices have put Cady's mental health in jeopardy and possibly caused long-term damage to her. I also appreciated Gemma's team (Cole and Tess) calling her out for her continued disregard of Cady in favour of her work. Surprisingly, M3gan also had a few moments when she's trying to convince people to see things \""her\"" way that she was surprisingly persuasive. Those moments helped me see her as more than just a mindless murdering machine. The only character that they missed the mark with is Gemma's boss David who is just too cartoonish to buy as an actual person. This decision seems to have been made to help make the corporate climate in the movie feel more ridiculous but they could have turned it down a notch without harming the overall tone. I wouldn't call it exemplary or superior character building but there's enough work put in to build tension and get you to care about the characters even if it's in a passive way.\n\nM3gan only centres around a few characters so there isn't a huge cast to talk about. Allison Williams capably anchors the movie as Gemma. I haven't seen her in much since Get Out but her work in that was no fluke. She sells the unlikeable Gemma and then when she learns the error of her ways, she does a decent job of managing the turn. Violet McGraw does a good job as the largely meek and gentle Cady. Her scenes where she flips out are startling and not as believable but she still grades out well overall. Ronny Chieng is a little over-the-top as David but I have to assume he was being directed that way, even if not I still appreciate that he went for it as opposed to just slouching through it. Lori Dungey was also good, her character starts out as unassuming but becomes nastier as the proceedings keep moving. She kept it light enough to keep you from getting distracted but dark enough that you only felt so bad for her.\n\nI've talked about almost all of the other larger components of M3gan, the biggest and most notable takeaway is that if you've got a darker sense of humour, M3gan is pretty funny throughout. From minute one, M3gan let's you know what's up. The original Funki toys are so off-putting that they can't be taken sincerely and their functions are so comedic that the movie is making poop jokes with them. As much as I want to credit the design work and acting required to bring M3gan to life, she's so far in the uncanny valley that she must be a permanent resident. The thought that anyone would buy her for their child is laughable. If you saw her in real life, you would shriek and run the other way instead of trusting her to care for your kids. To the movie's credit, this is clearly done intentionally and the creative team is winking at the audience. The scene where M3gan starts dancing to distract her prey is so creepily comedic that I was openly laughing at the thought that anyone would take it seriously. M3gan isn't as uproarious as the Happy Death Day series but they hit the right balance to make a good campy comedy.\n\nMy advice with M3gan is to not take it too earnestly and go in ready to acknowledge how ridiculous it is. You're clearly supposed to be laughing with it and I did continuously. The critical praise has been a little hyperbolic but it's more difficult to achieve the correct mixture for something like this to work. I would happily recommend M3gan to horror enthusiasts looking for something that plays with the formula for comedic effect. I would grade it as a 7.5/10 rounding up in this case to an 8/10.

They have maintained a balance between realistic and rather commercialized unrealistic sequences. This last 1 hr or so held on to my attention right till the last second of this film. It was that interesting and gripping!\n\nThe last part made me really emotional. His parents , unsure about what Sandeep's condition is, suddenly finding their son on tv being shown martyred was really painful and emotional for me to watch. Don't miss these parts.\n\nOther than that, there are certain fictionalized sequences that are far from realistic like some of Sandeep's acrobatics (mind you , as i said, it is done to make the film presentable to masses) or the terrorists being shown arriving at daytime while actually they arrived in the evening in dark time. Of course, by now we have seen so many 26/11 based films and sequences and all present that day in their own way.\n\nThe media angle is presented in a sarcastic way here with little fiction. We all know how terrorists were using the idiotic media to track commandos but here Watch out for a fictional sequence where Sandeep would turn the tables and use the media to wreck the terrorists instead. That was like an \""ooooooooo\"" moment. In fact there is one hilarious sarcastic sequence where a media guy covering Nariman Point would see the commandos getting killed and says on live news \""I can't understand how the terrorists are able to figure out that commandos are coming \"" as he keeps covering them live. It was sarcastic.\n\nSongs , not one to remember. Performance by Adivi Shesh is terrific. He looks just young enough to represent Major Sandeep. He excels in the last 1 hr. Saiee Manj is average as she carries her one expression throughout the film. Prakash Raj too does a good job .\n\nOverall, must watch! Full on entertainment guaranteed .

This is her comeback as a film director since 2013, as since 2013, she has directed more short films and several TV episode of various shows.\n\nThe film is about popular singer Kat Valdez (Jennifer Lopez), who, together with her singing partner Bastian (Maluma), are about to release their new album Marry Me and then get married themselves. When Kat learns that Bastian has cheated on her, she cancels the wedding plan and concert. She then sees Charlie Gilbert (Owen Wilson) in the audience with a sign that says Marry Me and decides to spontaneously marry him during her show. This is how the lives of both Kat and Charlie change. Kat now seems a bit desperate by marrying a total stranger, while Charlie suddenly finds himself in the publicity he is not used to at all. The two are just trying to make the best of it together, but now have to go through the publicity and criticism of the news and social media.\n\nFor a romantic comedy, this film initially comes across as two separate stories of Kat and Charlie, who occasionally come together for a press conference or an interview. In Kat's story she just tries to lead a star life and to work around the criticism of others. In Charlie's story, he then tries to improve the bond between him and his daughter. In the second half of the film, the two really come together more, but seem more like friends challenging each other to things than they really seem like a newlywed couple. The film does not come across as a romantic film and it remains more of a comedy. The story is also somewhat familiar and has some predictable or more unbelievable sides. Thus, only a few of the comedic moments in the film work, while the rest seem more impractical.\n\nThe acting in the film is well done, but otherwise not really special. Jennifer Lopez pretty much plays herself as a popular pop star going through a rough patch. Furthermore, she tries to remain in a good light for her fans and the press. In addition, in addition to the film, she also seems to promote the accompanying music album and also tries to sell it in addition to the film. The film often shows how she prepares for a concert and then you get to see a performance. Afterwards you get to see how she works on her song before she releases it or uses it in a performance. If they hadn't brought this up in the film in this way and just used the songs as a soundtrack, the film could have been shorter running and a little less tedious. In addition to the film, Kat Coiro has also directed music clips of songs from this film. They both seem to be trying to earn a little extra with this. For Maluma, this is his first acting job in a movie, but he's really just playing a famous singer just like he has done in his music career for the movie. That way he doesn't really get the chance to come forward as an actor.\n\nOwen Wilson comes across as an awkward man, who is used to a more quiet life and doesn't like popularity and social media, but now has to learn to deal with this. He also comes across well with Chloe Coleman as father and daughter who have become somewhat estranged from each other, but are trying to adjust.

'Me Time' is unfortunately the latter. This movie was not funny in the least bit.\n\nThe problem with Kevin Hart, and the reason I almost never enjoy his movies, is that they're based around energy rather than clever writing. He does bring energy to a movie but that doesn't do it for me. I need some intelligence in the script. Hart is more likely to try and find comedy in slipping on something on the floor, than making a clever observation or witty retort.\n\nMark Wahlberg can be great in comedies but he needs to be playing off someone who is truly funny. When he's in the 'Ted' movies opposite Seth MacFarlane or opposite Will Ferrell in something like 'The Other Guys' he can play the straight guy and make the other guy even funnier. When the other guy isn't funny like Hart however, Wahlberg's performance comes across very flat as it does in 'Me Time'.\n\nIf we learnt anything from 'Scary Movie' and the 2022 Oscars it is that Regina Hall is probably the most talented comic this film has.

The acting was mediocre, the story has a moment of strength then collapses, and it's just the same old plot with a slightly different twist.\n\nThe acting by Liam Neeson and Guy Pearce was good. I found that Neeson was stronger this time around compared to some of his other latest roles, and Pearce fit the role of FBI agent quite well. However, some of the major supporting just didn't seem to care at times. They lacked passion in the role or felt a little awkward.\n\nThe concept of the film was interesting. Guy is an assassin and taking on one last job until it interferes with his personal code. Then he turns around and begins killing those who've wronged him on the mission, but not without the difficulty of memory loss.\n\nOn paper it seems like a cool movie with cool characters and a relatively strong story that would be enjoyable. Until you watch it and the parts that tell the story are rushed and the parts that are fillers drag on and take more of the runtime. And honestly, the runtime already feels long at and hour and fifty-four minutes.\n\nOverall, I was once again disappointed with a Liam Neeson film.

Because his current contract involves murdering a 13-year-old girl, Beatriz (Mia Sanchez), he's not going to do it, period! Per usual, Neeson's hardcore vigilante has his limits: Involving children is a non-no, and it's an immediate softener for the audience. Plus, such a code allows the essential Neeson to emerge-a good guy underneath his \""special skills.\""\n\nThis refinement of past assignments, this surfacing of a standard that brooks no trafficking in young people, is a moral advance for an immoral assassin. The audience immediately sides with the hit man and shows no sympathy for the rich people doing the reprehensible trafficking. Memory's loaded with sympathy for Alex, especially when he connects with FBI agent Vincent, played by Guy Pearce (a nice touch as we remember him in that classic thriller, Memento). Both are tough men on the opposite sides of the law, who have a sympathetic side that ingratiates without sapping the tough guy the audience has always savored.\n\nThe strongest leitmotif is that of memory, or the lack thereof, so that the early-onset Alzheimer's plays a technical part of the plot and a thematic reminder that combating trafficking is going to involve memory, not just of the computer kind. One memory Alex never loses is the murder of young Beatriz, for whose violent end Alex was not responsible.\n\nAlong the way, this layered thriller comments on the limits of justice and the questionable answer of vigilantism.

Auteur Alex Garland has crafted a film so enjoyably horrific and thematically loaded as to please those tired of goody-two shoes super-heroes and limitless CGI.\n\nThis intense treatise on the wrong's men do to women uses the standard object of fear, a single woman, Harper (Jessie Buckley), in a secluded English Cotswold cottage mending a heart devastated by the death (or suicide) of her husband, James (Paapa Essiedu). Various men enter her life, not one redeemable and most just downright ugly even when they physical aren't.\n\nThe predominantly evil alpha male is a naked middle-aged man with scars to scare, who stalks her in a tunnel on the path and back to her house, even after the police roust him out but have to let him out. Even a seemingly benign local prelate has sexist views about her driving her husband to suicide, so she seems to have no protector except another female on a smart phone 4 hours away. Harper is alone with demented men, a perfect scenario for the horror-flick formula.\n\nGarland has done a yeoman's job larding his tale with symbols right down to when he offers pagan imagery of green men and Sheela-Na-Gigs, which help counter the misanthropy in favor of the men, who are misogynists. In effect, Garland has spent an entire film deriding the men but finds women also with some horrific responsibility.\n\nYou're not quite sure what I mean when I characterize Garland as sated with symbols? Consider this obvious allegory: As Harper arrives at the cottage, she spies an apple tree from which she plucks and eats an apple, only to be chided by the owner, Jeff (Rory Kinnear).\n\nAs a former English major, I delighted in the figurative gymnastics and multiple themes. However, the final birth scenes are almost too graphic for most women to stomach, much less delicate English major men. But the stuff of hard-core horror the images are.\n\nAnyway, if you're a female, you may enjoy the men in Men as stalking, walking misogynists, and if you're a male, just run and hide, but not in the Cotswolds."", ""Upvotes"": ""122"", ""Downvotes"": ""125"", ""Reviewer"": ""JohnDeSando""}, {""Title"": ""What Was This?"", ""Rating"": ""3"", ""Review Content"": ""I give props to the cinematography, special effects, and the performances; particularly those of Jessie Buckley and Rory Kinnear.

B. Weiss and director Peter Sollett as I sat down to watch the movie. Why? Well, first of all I hadn't heard about the movie, so I wasn't sure what I was in for here. And secondly, then the synopsis for the movie just seemed a bit too generic for a movie of this kind. But still, I opted to watch \""Metal Lords\"".\n\nTurns out that \""Metal Lords\"" was actually rather enjoyable. Sure, it was somewhat on the generic side in terms of innovation and creativity for a movie such as this. But still, it proved to be an enjoyable and entertaining movie. And that was definitely a large part because of the cast and their performances. But the storyline certainly was adequate enough.\n\nLead actors Adrian Greensmith (playing Hunter) and Jaeden Martell (playing Kevin) were rather well-cast for \""Metal Lords\"", and they carried the movie quite well.\n\nI will say that \""Metal Lords\"" was definitely a movie suited for me, because I've been listening to metal since I was around 11 or 12 years old or so, and been playing roleplaying games for that very same amount of time, and I am almost 47 by now. So the metal references and the Dungeons & Dragons references throughout the movie were as if tailored for my interests.\n\nI was genuinely entertained by \""Metal Lords\"", because it was a movie that transcended being just another run-of-the-mill movie about youngsters forming a metal band and going against the mainstream. There were also good elements of friendship, love, being an outsider and not a bland face in the crowd, and such, so it was a well-rounded movie.\n\nMy rating of \""Metal Lords\"" lands on a seven out of ten stars."", ""Upvotes"": ""141"", ""Downvotes"": ""23"", ""Reviewer"": ""paul_haakonsen""}, {""Title"": ""Funny but serious.

Looking at the fate of his earlier Mard Ko Dard Nahi Hota (2019) which bombed despite being its brilliance, a direct OTT seems to be a wise strategy.\n\nCut to the film, it starts with an accident suspiciously looking like a murder and then time-travels six years ahead. Jayant (Rajkummar Rao) is the newly crowned director of a Robotics company Unicorn. He is dating the CEO (veteran Vijay Kenkre)'s daughter Nikki (Akansha) until the secretary Monica (Huma Qureshi) drops the \""Main tumhare bachcha ki maa\"" bomb on him. Then the game of blackmail and murder starts and soon enough, Unicorn becomes the epicenter of crime as each one of its top executives are bumped off one by one!!\n\nThe screenplay is wonderfully woven in to a tight two hours ten minutes of thrilling ride which keeps you hooked and engaged throughout. There are plenty of pop culture references like a hotel named Prince Amar after Dev Saahab's immortal character in Jewel Thief (1967) and Dharmendra's iconic moment from Johnny Gaddar (2007) appearing at a crucial juncture. Vasan Bala even references his own movie by adding a fleeting appearances of his two leads. Its all fun, its pure retro and its highly entertaining.\n\nThe performances are also first rate. Huma Qureshi is super duper as Monica Machado, the sexy secretary who has an affair too many for her own good. Rajkummar Rao is assuredly competent in a complex role where he doesn't know whom to trust!! Sikandar Kher springs a surprise as the CEO's sidelined and silently conspiring beta. It's good to see Shiva Rindani on screen after eons.. he's referred as Captain Zattack in one scene. Waah!! Radhika Apte as the investigating cop, doesn't get much scope but still leaves her solid mark.\n\nMonica O My Darling indulges in multiple genres at the same time. There is black humour, murder mystery, office politics, survival drama etc all mixed together perfectly. I loved the moment when Rajkummar and Huma get in to a deadly physical brawl, stop at one point and then reconcile. It reminded me of Sriram Raghavan's far brilliant Johnny Gaddar (2007).

Except that this was beyond worse than what we had imagined.\n\nI like the idea of the film, that the moon is a threat to humanity. It's different but that's the only excellent thing to say about it. Other than that, it's a threat to our IQ.\n\nThe biggest fault with Moonfall is that it fails to project the most basic principle to making a good disaster film which is creating a sense of fear for the audience. It almost doesn't have any, resulting in a boring entry. I did not get scared or restless, it didn't connect with me on a deeper level and it certainly doesn't have a good story to keep us at the edge of our seat hence, I couldn't care less if anyone dies. I didn't have the urgency to follow all the important people trying to put a stop from the catastrophic event because they throw all stakes out the window just like the Fast & Furious franchise. The main characters are ordinary people built extraordinarily strong.\n\nAdding the grim fact that Moonfall includes aliens composed of A. I and technology while also trying to relate to the audience by making it realistic, it falls down to the bottom of the abyss quickly. It doesn't work like other alien-based films like Prometheus or War of the Worlds did where they succeed in creating fear, showing people panicking while sucking us inside the experience.\n\nYes, we are supposed to surrender from the sheer silliness of it but how can we when we are made to believe that its law of physics and world principles should follow ours and they broke every threshold to the point that we feel like this is a spin-off of the Transformers franchise.\n\nThis marketed end-of-the-world disaster flick film is extremely ridiculous, even if you suspend your disbelief, you would never get your head around the plot. Not because you're dumb, but because the movie is, and I mean REALLY, REALLY dumb. It's like it's been written by Roland Emmerich's son and his dad helped him by putting scientific jargons to make it believable. Only if it did. 😩 And here I thought Independence Day 2: Resurgence was a trash, Moonfall is a shame to humanity's existence.\n\nUsually the end of the world presents seas of people running away, but Moonfall doesn't. It's a blockbuster movie about apocalypse and yet, it feels small at times. There even isn't that many shots that 'wow' us with horrific sceneries or powerful images like 2012 or The Day After Tomorrow. Even the CGI isn't all that good especially when a person is talking mid-shot and the CGI looks awful in the background.\n\nNow don't get me started with the cheap comedy. I'm confused whether it's intended to make us annoyed or laugh cause I didn't laugh one bit and neither did the audience I was with.\n\nI know loving or hating a film is fully entitled to a person's taste and opinion but this movie is so bad, I dare to say this; if you like the film, you are an immature person and you have a bad taste.\n\nOkay, maybe some of you are asking me to calm down as you're reading this but imagine the hundreds or thousands of scripts just stacking there in the room, unread because it's written by a nobody or it's got some minor English errors. And they chose this to be greenlit amongst those??? It saddens me that the political game of the Hollywood industry has come to this. Emmerich was a great director but his ideas have now diluted less and less.\n\nVerdict: Just when you thought Fast 9 is the most ridiculous film ever made, Moonfall steals the baton happily from its opponent.

I know many people say this about a lot of superhero films, but coming from a horror lovers perspective- as well as fitting the atmospheric and tone Life director Daniel Espinosa seemed to pair within it- this movie really should have been rated R. It feels like Sony really did censor and edit this one as much as they could have, with the blood and violence being as limited as possible. It takes away from the experience as a whole, one moment in particular where a man acts like his throat is cut open but there is LITERALLY NOTHING THERE. Unsurprisingly, as with the case with a lot of films like this, the CGI can be a bit overused at times. For the most part I liked the look of vampire blood hungry Morbius taken on by Jared Leto- but other similar CGI and at times that CGI itself can feel a bit too ugly and forced for comfort. The fight scenes towards the end in particular are also overdone with CGI, and I just really wish Sony would have let the people working on this film give some life to the project instead of worrying about its box office gross. I know i've complained a lot so far, but in terms of a film- I oddly did enjoy this one for the most part. Sure it's messy, Matt Smith's character is a bit over the top and it has some formulaic moments- but it is a very entertaining film. Leto and Arjona give their all to their performances and it has a lot of cool ideas and concepts that are interesting to see fleshed out on screen- particularly with Morbius in particular as he begins to learn how to control himself. There's a lot of humanity hidden beneath the surface in this film though, even with some formulaic moments, there's a lot of depth and heart put into the titular character and it really allows you to empathize both with the film's story as well as Leto on screen.

Darby is alerted her mother has suffered a brain aneurysm and is now in the hospital but her doctor is unavailable to sign off any outside communication or furlough. Out of desperation Darby steals one of the facility workers vehicles intent on driving to Salt Lake City to visit her mother in the hospital despite her estrangement from her family who've made clear they don't want her there. Bad weather causes road closures and Darby is directed to the Muir's Rest visitors center where four others consisting of husband and wife Ed (Dennis Haysbert) and Sandi (Dale Dickey), and others Ash (Danny Ramirez) and Lars (David Rysdahl). As Darby tries in vain to get a signal in the parking lot, she comes across a beat up windowless ban where a child is bound and gagged in the back. Unable to dial 911, Darby must now figure out who of the strangers she's stuck with is the abductor and survive the storm and the night.\n\nNo Exit is an adaptation of the 2017 novel of the same name by Taylor Adams. The film is directed by Damien Power whose previous effort was the well regarded 2016 horror film Killing Ground and written by scribes Andrew Barrer and Gabriel Ferrari whose previous credits include the MCU film Ant Man and the Wasp as well as the critically maligned Die in a Gunfight that while appearing on the annual Blacklist of best unproduced screenplays had a troubled production. No Exit takes a small scale premise and creates a suitably twisty and engaging thriller.\n\nHavana Rose Liu fantastic in the lead as Darby Thorne and this is Liu's first time playing a lead having done a handful of supporting work before this. We get some solid moments of Liu dealing with her past trauma and showing sides of acerbic cynicism and emotional vulnerability and with the more physically challenging bits that come through later in the film I really feel this could be a star making performance for Liu and can't wait to see what's next for her. The movie being a limited location piece is predicated upon having a strong supporting cast and we get that with an eclectic bunch of character actors making up those at the rest stop with reliable stapes like the always welcome Dennis Haysbert and Dale Dickey as well as strong relatively newish actors like Danny Ramirez and David Rysdahl. Damien Power shows a solid handling of this type of limited location thriller with solid establishment of the Visitors Center and its surrounding locales and you feel the bitterness of the cold, the oppressiveness of the isolation, and tension and unease of the group with every moment.\n\nThe script by Andrew Barrer and Gabriel Ferrari is taut and well-paced with character, situation, and stakes effectively established while keeping the audience on edge. For the most part the movie is framed from Darby's point of view so we're very much in her shoes as she's trapped in this building in the middle of nowhere with no way out. The story is suitably twisty with solid revelations and reversals as expected for a movie of this ilk, but I wasn't completely sold on one revelation towards the third act. Admittedly it wasn't a \""breaker\"" for me personally but it felt like the movie overextended itself a bit in how certain things were connected but your mileage may vary.\n\nNo Exit is a solid thriller anchored by a breakout lead from Havana Rose Liu as Darby Thorne, with a strong supporting cast and strong sense of isolation and unease created by director Damien Power from a taut well-paced script by Andrew Barrer and Gabriel Ferrari, No Exit makes for some good thrills that don't let up until the end.

I am very pleasantly surprised with how well done this was and how much I enjoyed this film. I had no doubt with Jordan Peele he would do something good but he has set a new bar in the psychological, thriller, horror genre.\n\nI don't know where to start as I have so many thoughts racing through my brain, so I'll start simple. Great cinematography this film was beautiful and looked great on the IMAX screen. Great writing and I have to stop to say the writing in this film is superior to the writing in Get Out and Us. Jordan Peele's writing talent has come a long way since those films. The dialogue and chemistry between actors and characters was so organic, it just felt so natural and nothing feeling forced. Speaking of things not feeling forced the comedy and jokes, all do so well and don't detract from the serious tone of the film.\n\nWhich will lead me to great acting. Daniel Kaluuya, Keke Palmer, Brandon Perea, and Steven Yeun (just to name a few of the films stars) all give tremendous performances. It was so great to see Steven Yeun as I haven't seen him in anything since he starred as Glenn Rhee in The Walking Dead. Amazing sound design and sound effects, it truly brought the tension and horror to tremendous heights it had me on the edge of my sit.\n\nNow I want to discuss the viewing experience as it has been a long time since a horror film truly had an impact on me. Some genuinely terrifying moments that like I said had me on the edge of my seat. I am not easily scared and jump scares I find them to be cheap and weak but there were some scares here that genuinely made me jump. At one moment I found myself saying \""nope, not today Satan\"" I'm sure there will be a lot of \""nope\"" remarks from audience members. But is this worth the IMAX screen? To that question I'd say yes and no. This film did not make much use of IMAX cameras which throughout the film made me question why is it in IMAX? But I have to say when the IMAX sequences finally came along it was great. The utilization of the IMAX cameras in certain scenes made for a great pay off and of course coupled with the great IMAX sound it heightened the viewing experience. But I can't say it was a must watch in IMAX. To steer away from spoilers I will simply say a teaser trailer for a certain upcoming film from my favorite director made watching it in IMAX well worth it.\n\nI'll start wrapping this up as I'm sure some people who saw the amount of text in this review thought \""nope, I'm not reading all that\"" no pun intended. The only real downside of this film for me was it did lose a little steam in the conclusion and I didn't feel satisfied nor unsatisfied. I still have a lot of questions and would like some more information but perhaps these questions are answered in the film and I missed them. I definitely plan on multiple viewings of this film.\n\nThis is my new favorite Jordan Peele film, better than his recent film Us and right up there with Get Out while surpassing it. I would rate this film between a 8.5 or 8.9 but because I don't like half scores I'm going to give it the full 9 because of how this film at moments genuinely had me jumping. It was a fun, exciting, thrill ride from start to finish. I look forward to whatever comes next from Jordan Peele.\n\nIMDb: 9/10 Letterboxd: 4/5\n\nWatched in IMAX Theater."", ""Upvotes"": ""332"", ""Downvotes"": ""299"", ""Reviewer"": ""nscoby93""}, {""Title"": ""Nope, it doesn't flow like the others, but still has that Peele twist"", ""Rating"": ""8"", ""Review Content"": ""LIKES:\n\nThe Comedy At Times: Peele knows how to put comedy into his work and often to maximize the laughs. He does this very well again, using so little to accomplish so much without trying. His skits with Keele showed putting a lot of energy, but for Nope, the comedy is much more controlled, dropped in at the right times to try and offset the tension. Peele manages to put a lot of fun into the writing from the blunt delivery of Kaluuya's lines to the energetic come get some of Palmer's character Em, it just comes off natural and is not too wedged in to get in the way of the movie. It's also sprinkled nicely throughout the movie, and finding the right time to spice up the moment.\n\nThe Pace Mostly: For a movie that promised to be elevated horror and potentially very deep, the pacing was decent for this writer. Nope starts out the same style of Peele's work, taking lots of time set up the pieces and give you inklings of how everyone will be connected. Then as the events start to happen, he manages to ramp things up and start focusing on uncovering elements, all while still focusing on that character development. It's the intrigue that pulled me in, trying to see what the next the level to the story was all while trying to discover the twist he had in store. The pace continued to be like that for much of the film, until right about the end where things changed, but for about 75% of the movie, the pace was thrilling for this horror movie.\n\nThe Twist: Peele has always found a way to put his shocking imagination to the works and really keep you guessing as to what the spin to the story will be. Once again, he does not fail to deliver, bringing with it elevated levels of viewing the world and clever symbolism to show the state of the world. His use famous verses and quotes, mixed with subtle signs and visual aids, all work to be that level of poetic disposition he does so well, allowing one to interpret the message to their liking. And yet, for those who just want straight gimmicks and entertainment, Peele is there to give you an odd change to formula that may or may not be impressive to you. For me, he again uses it well and gives the science fiction genre a nice refresh that has plenty to offer the horror element, some shots he used very well to display it. That thrill part really makes the story take a new element and the way he integrates in the odd manner at the end.\n\nThe Horror Elements/Tension: Now we are getting to the stuff most care about for the genre, and in this film the horror elements are certainly creative and well done at times. Nope works on several levels to give you the chills experience, starting with the odd and offset, where just enough hints are given to bait you, but have not given everything away. They then start adding tension to the mix, using elements to build up the moment with use of shadows, the feeling of abandonment and the use of shadows. Soon, crazy things start getting immersed into the movie, and the sickening elements bleed in, nods to the classic horror movies, as the disturbing visuals get their moment creep you out. Finally, the tension at the end as the whole finale hits, gives you that intensity to help maintain the edge, but drops the horror element for something else. Again, there is a wicked nature to the whole thing that darker beings will love to watch.\n\nThe Acting: You've heard it from many, but no surprise, Nope has an A game of cast to bring this movie to life. Once more, all the cast hits their shining moment and brings that intricacy that the film needs to make sure it comes off creepy. For the big three though we have a few more words to say. Perea is the guy who is the blend of both characters, the sort of comedic support a film needs to help offset the horror. He's a fun character to dive into and certainly makes for an entertaining lead with plenty of jokes to throw into the fire. However, the two leads are the brother and sister duo of OJ and Em, and the group who portray them. Palmer is energetic, bringing sass and fire that is trying to bring the ranch to modern times and challenge the threat at hand. She's the visionary of the group, and her energy livens up the rather serious tone without shattering the believability or elements of the story. It really works and she executes it so well that you can't help but get pulled into all the traits she brings. As for Kaluuya, he transitions well into the modern cowboy roles and I was very impressed with how much he was able to do with so few words spoken. There is just something in his performance and mannerisms that works so well, and I was very happy to see how Peele used his talents to really make the simplistic character layered in comedy, story, and just plain laughs.\n\nThe Cinematography: By far, my favorite was the cinematography and the sound that went with it. Nope is all about the right shot to get the moment perfectly terrifying and Peele's team did it beautifully in bringing the odd encounter to life. Shadows as mentioned earlier are deceptive and haunting, leaving you feeling isolated, but yet watched. The angles of the saucer attack grip you into the experience and find a way to make the whole ordeal as gruesome and terrifying as you expect. Even the emotional moments has all the right direction to them and I felt the presence of every moment in the presentation they brought us. Thrown in great sound elements to back it up, or lack of it some cases, and Nope's technical aspect achieves great thing for this reviewer to make it worthwhile to visit in theaters.\n\nDISLIKES:\n\nPlot Holes/Underused Elements: I agree with other reviewers that Peele's plot seemed a little less put together as some of his other works. Nope holds a lot of elements to it, but in terms of complete character story, full on challenges, and even answers to some brimming questions the movie does not quite wrap things up as neatly as he does. The random film element tie in for one character is certainly interesting, but is this awkward tangent that is more a symbolic poke at something and could have been left out. A legendary camera man seems to have a lot prowess and logic, but then things happen to counter that, subtle hints being seen that don't quite make sense and seem a bit hurried. Even Angel's background is sort of like a stoner secondary character that would have been nice to flesh out. All in all, these elements are present enough to get you thinking and serve as the sword slash to modern day culture, but don't quite fit as nicely together like other parts of his movies.\n\nCross the Line a Little On One my elements: I can't really say much without ruining a twist, but there is a bit of animal cruelty in this movie that is not my particular taste. As human as many productions are, there are some portrayals that I'm just not a fan of watching and Peele sometimes cross the line for me. I have to give him props for keeping it relevant, but there were other moments I would have preferred not to see.\n\nA Few Random Elements That Seemed Jammed In: This has to do with the ending where a lot of things happen very quickly in the climactic finale. Particularly the introduction of a random character whose name holds the symbolic nature, the smoothness of the final moment is mediocre for this reviewer. These elements may have held more shine in the poke fun at modern times role, however story wise seemed out of place and less useful than just adding more to the other characters we were already invested in. Sure, Peele does have some set up to help out and throw real world logic into it, but it just did not seem useful given what was about to happen.\n\nThe Pacing: As mentioned, the pace is definitely interesting for about 70-75% of the film, but that other part is a little up and down for me. Watching it unfold at times, the movie drags a bit, going down this element that is supposed to mean something big, but again barely fits into the ordeal they are crafting. Meanwhile, the ending seems very rushed, with things happening that just don't make sense nor have the tie ups I like to see in his work. There are \""changes\"" that happen to the characters, but they are so sudden with only tidbits of dialogue to support them that you wonder a bit more why they did what they did. Watching breakdowns from the artistic point works, but as for story elements it's a bit disappointing for the average viewer.\n\nThe Verdict:\n\nNope is a movie with an interesting name, and like most of Peele's work an interesting premise for both artistic sakes and horror sakes. He finds a way to merge the three worlds of mystery, horror, and sci-fi into this layered film, that is pretentious, but still holds entertaining elements that we like to see. Great acting, a deep story, horror elements that take advantage of so many things, alongside supreme visuals are the keys to what makes this movie hold a lot of bite. It's weird, it's convoluted, and yet it works if you can get onboard with his trippy thriller work from the past. However, the movie is not my favorite of the bunch and does not quite get the smoothness that I've seen in the past of this film. It's rushed at times, boring at others, with a story element running tangent that does not quite mesh as well as other origin elements of previous works. Still, it's a fun movie with a few moments worth rewatching, and for those enjoying symbolic takes of the times, worth even more views to dissect all Peele has crammed into the film. Definitely worth a trip to the movies for this one, and I encourage you to take a moment and view it where you can.\n\nMy scores are:\n\nHorror/Mystery/Sci-Fi: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0."", ""Upvotes"": ""242"", ""Downvotes"": ""225"", ""Reviewer"": ""rgkarim""}]"

I also found that this is probably the most \""new-to-One Piece\"" accessible since Film Gold, requiring little for a new person to comprehend without requiring a huge history of the franchise.\n\nThe pacing of the film is energetic, driven by the emotional core of the film in Uta. It is incredibly refreshing to see an emotional driven and well written (female!) character run the plot of the film. Uta's unique powers combined with actual musical scores adds a layer to the film solely unique and allows the film to stand out among the others.\n\nLuffy and company are put in reaction mode for most of the movie, which is really the only fault of the film I have. It's fine whenever Uta strongly drives the plot along, but other side characters show up either for convenience or exposition fairly frequently. The Strawhat crew get to showcase their flashy attacks, but there's only a few brief moments where they get to use their personality to shine (I'd say Usopp and Sanji in particular stand out in key moments, and it's unfortunate Jinbe doesn't have anything key for him to do in his first film appearance.)\n\nI do however appreciate how strongly Luffy plays off Uta and establishes a foil to Luffy that isn't some random stranger he meets once. Luffy and Uta's character beliefs are played perfectly around their idolization of Shanks. It is phenomenal that Shanks & his company are given an actual visual highlight in film to showcase exactly why Shanks is an Emperor and Roger's legacy.\n\nLastly, the CGI effects are bright and intentionally cartoony for great effect. The use of color to set mood is vastly important. CGI used especially within the film's finale is overwhelming but thankfully not ugly or distracting from the action taking place (again unlike Stampede). The final conflict has masterful use of animation to deliver an amazing finish.\n\nI feel a lot of the unfavorable reviews missed the point: The antagonist isn't so much the character, but rather complex and conflicting emotions driving this individual to commit to a cause without comprehending their actions. Reviewers who go in expecting a low-emotional stakes Shonen will be sorely confused. One Piece has always been held up significantly more by the emotional investments of is characters, rather than it's combat. I honestly prefer this film OVER Film Z in terms of how to make an antagonist that earns their sympathy while also still being threatening."", ""Upvotes"": ""26"", ""Downvotes"": ""23"", ""Reviewer"": ""zhyates""}]"

They had only hoped A24 would agree to make the film. Fortunately, the project was green-lit before filming began on X.",United States,English,7,(135K),"[{""Title"": ""Twisted, poignant, and macabre by turns"", ""Rating"": ""9"", ""Review Content"": ""\""Pearl\"" is Ti West's followup to the 1970s-set \""X\"", which serves as an origin story for that film's villain. It focuses on her life as a lonely and whimsical young woman who feels stifled by her obligations caring for her family in 1918 Texas while her husband serves in World War I. Pearl's only outlet is the local cinema, where she is invigorated by the glamour of motion pictures and dreams of being a star. Pearl's longing for a more thrilling life--along with some ostensibly psychological predispositions to insanity--drive her to do some unspeakable things.\n\nThough branded as a \""Technicolor slasher\"" of sorts, \""Pearl\"" is, in truth, more of a twisted psychological family drama, and a character study of a deeply sad outsider who feels her life is slipping away from her; her dreams, desires, and impulses out of reach due to her circumstances. This theme was tapped upon in \""X\"", which showed the character at the end of her life, and this exploration of where she came from is demented and poignant by turns. The film is notably effective because this existential theme is one that is endemic to being a human--a fear for many that, no matter where we are in our lives, is ever-present--all of the \""what-ifs\"", the mourning of \""lost\"" time, and even worse: the possibility that where we are is in fact where we belong.\n\nThis film would not work without Mia Goth's performance, which is truly remarkable. Here, she portrays an outsider anti-hero that is steeped in nuance and conflicting character traits (and flaws). Her ennui and sadness is empathetically played, and one can sense that Goth herself, on some level, identifies with Pearl's pain. She lends the role a potent mixture of naiveté, delicateness, and pure, murderous rage. While Pearl is all of these things, she is also none of them entirely, and thanks to Goth's performance (and the screenplay, which she had a hand in co-crafting with West), the character emerges as multilayered and human despite her propensity for evil. Encircling Goth is a solid supporting cast who are all capable of meeting her intensity with varying degrees of bewilderment, disgust, and sheer terror.\n\n\""Pearl\"" does indeed edge into slasher territory in its third act, and the film as a whole is a visual feast--garishly colorful, and tipping its hat to a number of films. \""The Wizard of Oz\"" is an obvious cornerstone, but there are visual and symbolic nods to \""Repulsion\"" and, even more heavily, Frederick Friedel's obscure farm-set \""Axe\"", another film that follows a mysterious (and murderous) young woman caring for her infirm grandfather on a rural farm. As with \""X\"", West uses these influences smartly without browbeating the audience or pushing the film's content over the edge into pure pastiche, and the film downshifts in its denouement in a way that is unexpectedly touching, despite all the spilt blood and entrails.\n\nAs a companion piece to \""X\"", \""Pearl\"" may leave some fans of its predecessor underwhelmed, largely because it is so tonally different and not the conventional \""slasher\"" film that might be expected. However, as a nuanced character study of a budding serial killer, it could not possibly be any better. \""Pearl\"" stands tall as a disturbing and strangely heartbreaking portrait of a person who, upon finding that her search for meaning and validation from others leads her nowhere, is then only capable of destroying them. 9/10."", ""Upvotes"": ""335"", ""Downvotes"": ""106"", ""Reviewer"": ""drownsoda90""}, {""Title"": ""Mia Goth's performance is one for the ages"", ""Rating"": ""8"", ""Review Content"": ""Extremely entertaining throwback-appearing (think old Hollywood cinematography and score) blood-soaked origin story of a girl with big dreams.

And it's a great character study at that.\n\nIf you're ok with that, then you're in for a psychological treat.\n\nHighest praise must be given to Mia Goth. She co-wrote the screenplay this time around and it's clear she understands the character profoundly. Her performance is terrifying. On a dime, she is able to flip from sweet & innocent to bloodthirsty & vengeful to remorseful and empathetic all within the same scene, sometimes even within the same shot.\n\nIt is, no hyperbole, one of the best lead performances I have ever seen in the genre.\n\nWhen the protagonist of your story is a murdering psychopath, obviously there is a risk of alienating the audience. But that never happened because the script keeps all of Pearl's actions rooted in the festering grudges she holds toward her unfulfilling responsibilities and the subjectively monotonous life that she feels anchored to.\n\nPearl remains a sympathetic character because she is written as what a lot of us would become if we snapped and acted on every thought we had in our minds.\n\nLastly, the cinematography and other visual choices elevate the journey of madness we are following by adding surreal, otherworldly qualities to Pearl's fantasies that she indulges.\n\nThe only complaint that I have is that some of the dialogue could have done with a bit more polish. I understand that they were trying to mimic the over-the-top style of older films, but there were times when the spoken words felt cheesy when they should have had more power.\n\nI was not expecting it to be as psychologically hard-hitting as it was.

I must know watch \""X\"" as Pearl is a prequel to that film which is on my shelf in Blu-ray !!! P. S. This film reminds me of \"" Darling\""\n\nPearl is a serious, deliriously messed-up psychodrama with an amazing musical score, period piece accurate 1917 wardrobe and vintage early cars Terrific cinematography and disturbing imagery . A heavily Stylized slasher with some suburb kills that yield some tantalizing gory effects. This film won me over as it starts off as a very slow burn ! As the character study progresses and also the performance of Pearls overbearing mother played by talented Tandi Wright ;I found the merit of the film sneaks up on you ! It is terrifically accomplished and horribly gripping . 8.5/10\n\nNote: You must stay a watch the closing credits . It is excellent mind-f % $ k .The strained smile that Goth holds for more than three minutes behind the closing credits was a spur-of-the-moment inspiration from Ti West. He had planned to film her smiling and then choose a freeze-frame of the most unsettling shot, but at the last minute suggested \""What if you hold a smile as long as you possibly can and let's see what happens?\"" They shot the smile, which \""goes from comical to haunting to deeply disturbing the longer it continues,\"" in one take."", ""Upvotes"": ""111"", ""Downvotes"": ""66"", ""Reviewer"": ""robfollower""}]"

Austen novels like Persuasion have many inspiring heroines, but not many of them have beloved pets like Anne's rabbit. In truth, the only actual pet to be fully described in any Jane Austen story is Lady Bertram's little pug, but the 2005 version of Pride & Prejudice gave Caroline Bingley a lap dog, so there's some precedent. According to The Atlantic, Director Cracknell thought the rabbit was a useful device that gave Anne a Millennial vibe, and represented her feeling stuck as a spectator of her own life in her 20s and 30s, unsure of committing to her own choices.",United States,English,5.8,(38K),"[{""Title"": ""I couldn't be more disappointed."", ""Rating"": ""3"", ""Review Content"": ""I am a huge Jane Austen fan. Pride and Prejudice is my favorite (I am team Darcy all the way), but Persuasion may be my second favorite of her novels. I like the more mature story of a second chance romance...and the letter, often touted as the most romantic letter in literary history, is truly sigh worthy. I absolutely loved the 2007 BBC production starring Sally Hawkins, Rupert Penny-Jones, Anthony Head and Alice Kridge. That film really brought the story to life, building drama and tension that crests in the actual letter. Completely the opposite of this film.\n\nI really like Dakota Johnson and Henry Golding and, as mentioned, I love the source material...so I can honestly say I was very excited to see this film in the works and I was eagerly anticipating it's release. I was there at the stroke of midnight to watch and grew more and more dissatisfied as the film went on.\n\nIt's like the story received a Bridgerton-lite filter and not just modernized twists but a true dilution of the source material.\n\nThe film starts with our protagonist, Anne Elliot, speaking to the audience...which she proceeds to do through the entire film...and not in a writing in her journal or thinking kind of way, but full on looking at and speaking to the audience. I imagine they thought it was funny. I could handle it at the start for the set-up, but then it really just started to take you out of the story, serving more as a distraction than a storytelling aid.\n\nI was very disturbed that they turned Anne into a lush...her only pleasure seems to be drinking and she does it heavily throughout the film...including straight from the bottle. If you read the novel, this seems horribly out of character...which in the source material is above reproach.\n\nThe cast is given a multi-ethnic approach, similar in it's period inaccuracy as Bridgerton. It also gets a modern approach to sexuality as at one point it is alluded to that Lady Russell goes on European tours to have dalliances with men...something she and a young lady like Anne would never, ever have spoken about in reality.\n\nThere is an added feminist twist to the story (one that Austen didn't proved), Wentworth apologizes to Anne for her not being able to be in the navy and when Luisa and Anne discuss Wentworth's qualities...him listening to women is touted as a virtue. Fairly certain neither appear in the source material and seemed time period inappropriate.\n\nThen there is Mr. Elliot and Anne's straightforward banter, again highly inappropriate and inaccurate.\n\nNow for the story and it's changes...it was very strange to have Captain Wentworth telling Anne about how as an Admiral he would think \""what would Anne do\"" and that's what he would do...how she is calm in a crisis, etc....and all of this before Luisa hits her head. It's like they didn't the audience was smart enough to glean that from her actions in the moment...which happens later (while watching, I though are they going to skip the real scene altogether and just have his words suffice? But no then they go on to show the injury scene!?!?!?) Also having Captain Wentworth telling Anne that there is an understanding that he didn't mean...changes his character. He truly didn't know that his actions toward Luisa could be misconstrued as more serious...something he never intended as the final letter clears up for anyone in doubt. Then there is the final letter (which is pretty perfect as is)...it ends up being a badly paraphrased and watered down version that contains absolutely no angst or love at all. Of course it didn't help that absolutely no tension or drama was built up at this point.\n\nAdd in some additional period inaccuracies like resin jewelry, pierced earrings, small bust above the front door and inappropriate clasps...the details might have been an indication of the lack of attention this film was going to show.\n\nI did like the white and black pet rabbit, interesting touch that I didn't hate and Cosmo Jarvis was a bit of a sleeper surprise that I didn't hate in his role as Captain Wentworth.\n\nI rarely ever recommend a different film, but I feel I really have to in this case.

While his Pinocchio remake is certainly not entirely without its effective moments of visual splendor, it pains me to say that he has continued the trend of live-action Disney remakes that somehow manage to take everything about the original and make it significantly worse.\n\nEvery character and setting in this is less expressive and vibrant than it was in 1940, completely draining them of the personality and emotional resonance that once made them so memorable and beautiful.\n\nThe voice performances are lacklustre, to say the least. Every line of dialogue from Jiminy and Pinocchio is delivered with the exact same tone of voice. There is no variety to emotions, so the stakes are never clear.\n\nMonstro the whale is not built up at all in this version, so any sense that he is a feared, menacing presence is gone. The tension is nonexistent in the finale. The story's other villainous characters are equally disappointing, coming across as goofy and incompetent rather than calculating and manipulative.\n\nWorst of all, there are some narrative changes made in this version, and all of them make the themes of consequence and repentance lose their meaning and weight.\n\nIn this film, Pinocchio never has any moments when he learns the negative consequences of lying, stealing, and self-indulgence like he did in the original. He seems to know these things from the get-go, and he only finds himself in the marionette show and on pleasure island because of circumstance rather than by deliberate choice.\n\nOutside of a couple of visually creative scenes, this is a shallow, soulless copy of a once-profound story.

Now the movie is released, I can already see a good reason people will debate this and the 2019 Lion King. The 2022 Pinocchio remake may not be the worst Disney Plus film, but this could be the worst live action Disney remake to date. There are Pinocchio movies out there that do try to find a way to tell the story of the character well. But this is more of a recycled film from the original 1940 one. Despite it does have some of the performances that's fateful to the original film, it had a weak execution with a poorly written story, mediocre characters, overly dark setups, and awful looking visuals. The one thing I'll say the visuals got right is with Pinocchio himself. But for the most part, they can be out of place and most of the designs try way too hard to make animal characters realistic. I mean, we already gotten Ugly Sonic in Chip and Dale. What more do you want to do all that in, Disney Plus? Of course as a painfully pointless live action Disney remake, I recommend to skip this one and stick with the original film. But you know what, let's all be thankful at least we're getting the one by Del Toro at the end of the year. When that gets released, I can guarantee it will be the one you'd want to watch instead.

A kind Blue Fairy (Cynthia Erivo) answers his wish and gives life to Pinocchio (Benjamin Evan Ainsworth) but says to him if he wishes to be a real boy he'll have to do it himself by proving himself truthful, unselfish, and brave. A cricket named Jiminy Cricket (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is assigned by the Blue Fairy to be Pinocchio's conscience with the approval of the Blue Fairy, and Geppetto is ecstatic to find his wish has come true. It isn't long before Pinocchio while good natured does eventually find himself drawn to the allure of taking shortcuts and partaking in vices while Jiminy tries to keep him on the right track. While Pinocchio is drawn into a world of sinister characters, Jiminy tries to keep him on the straight and narrow. Geppetto sets off to find Pinocchio and eventually Pinocchio must try to rescue his father.\n\nPinocchio is the latest live-action remake of one of Disney's animated films that has become a major staple of the company as they continue mining the nostalgic value of their time-tested assets. The film is the latest in the Twin Film phenomenon wherein two competing studios release similar projects in a similar period of time and the fact that this is coming out the same year as Guillermo del Toro's long gestating stop-motion adaptation of Pinocchio due out on Netflix later this year makes this film seem less like any creatively driven endeavor and more like strategic brand protection on the part of the Walt Disney Company. Now I don't want to throw every live-action Disney remake under the bus as there have been some good ones such as Cinderella, Jungle Book, Christopher Robin and Pete's Dragon that try to take a unique direction with the material, but more often than not you'll get something like Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, or The Lion King which are only trying to recapture the animated films down to pretty much being animated themselves with all the heavy CGI that often goes into making these films. Pinocchio is unquestionably an example of the latter as Robert Zemeckis continues his slump and follows up his underwhelming The Witches remake with a remake that may be even worse.\n\nI will say one good thing about Pinocchio in that Tom Hanks is trying to give a good performance as Geppetto and upon initial introduction there was an attempt to expand on Geppetto's character and give him more weight as a character in comparison to the original where he was a kindhearted bumbler, and they try to add something for Hanks to tap into by making him a widower as well as having lost his own son. On the one hand the performance is good (at least in parts) but on the other the fact that Geppetto previously had his own family and lost them opens up some uncomfortable thematic subtext that of course the movie isn't interested in addressing, and when your Disney fairy tale is reminding me of turns taken by Steven Spielberg/Stanley Kubrick's A. I. or Osamu Tezuka's Astro Boy/Mighty Atom that actually did try to tap into similar territory except done better (less so in A. I.'s case) it's already a pretty clumsy introduction. Once we're past that we pretty much go through the exact same plot you remember from the original 1940 film with the wide eyed innocent Pinocchio going on a series of misadventures with eccentric characters but even in that respect the movie gets it wrong.\n\nUnlike in other versions of the story where Pinocchio has some level of agency and every misfortune that befalls him is the result of a decision he made ignoring his conscience, Pinocchio has little to no agency in this story as the narrative pushes him towards these misadventures rather than letting him pursue them himself and it makes the episodes Pinocchio encounters far less character based because the misfortunes are no longer in service of teaching Pinocchio a lesson and have lost their original intended purpose. When Pinocchio is sent to Stromboli's for instance, he does initially refuse the temptation, but it's only after being kicked out of school for \""being a puppet\"" that Pinocchio decides to accompany Honest John. A similar thing happens with the Pleasure Island episode where instead of him wanting to go to a land of no rules and excessive vice, he's swiped up from the street against his will and browbeaten into going and even when he does get there he looks pretty revolted by the display of misbehavior and there are long stretches of the movie where Jiminy isn't even with him so why even have Jiminy in this movie if Pinocchio can already tell right and wrong for himself?\n\nEven the nuts and bolts of the movie don't work. Pleasure Island for instance has been scrubbed relatively clean so instead of kids smoking cigars and drinking beer their misbehavior is now drinking root beer and eating mountains of candy but the wanton vandalism is still there so it's now a \""genlter\"" sort of misbehavior....which Pinocchio takes little to no part in. Aesthetically the film feels lifeless and inert. Despite Pinocchio allegedly being made of pine, the overall feeling I got from watching this film was of Rubber and Plastic, something that was both artificial and safe to a fault with absolutely no risk taken and just an excuse for money to be burnt copying a movie that's both widely available and most people already know by heart. While I don't know the budget of this film, given what we know about other Disney remakes this is most likely a very expensive movie but there's a cheapness to the production design because of how over rendered the environments are and despite now being live-action, the film still treats itself as though it were fully animated with Pinocchio, Jiminy Cricket, Cleo the goldfish, and even Figaro the kitten rendered in CGI that either looks unconvincing or falls into the uncanny valley as is the case with Cleo and Jiminy who look unnerving with their human like faces that mixed with rubbery CGI just look wrong. Pinocchio himself just looks like he's poorly integrated into the scenery and with as much CGI as there is in this movie this is probably the closest these Disney live-action remakes have come to going \""full cartoon\"".\n\nThe movie is also a musical, and not a very good one. Robert Zemeckis shows no flair for directing the musical numbers in the film with the renditions of original songs from the original film ranging from mediocre to okay, but the new songs are just unappealing to listen to and they're often awkwardly staged and directed with the Coachman's song in particular just being unappealing on both a visual and auditory level.\n\nPinocchio is a massive creative failure from Disney. While films such as Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin were also banal and soulless, I could at least appreciate some of the technical craft that went into them. Pinocchio on the other hand not only bungles its lead character and story, but it's also unappealing in both sound and visuals.

As she joins a group lead by her brother set on taking down a mountain lion, they soon come across a creature more dangerous than they've encountered before.\n\nPrey marks the first Predator movie made and released since Disney bought Fox and the first entry in the series since the underperformance of 2018's The Predator. The film began development under the working title of Skulls when director Dan Trachtenberg and screenwriter Patrick Aison approached series producer John Davis with the initial concept that would become Prey. Trachtenberg hasn't directed a feature film his breakout hit in 2016's 10 Cloverfield Lane with a number of projects he's been attached to either moving on without him or getting cancelled with Trachtenberg's largely being on TV. Prey marks both a welcome return for Trachtenberg as well as the Predator franchise as it's probably the best entry we've had since the first one.\n\nMuch like prior films Predator and Predator 2 which took established film staples such as commando and cop movies and turned them on their head with the inclusion of an alien trophy hunter, Prey takes a set of characters in its Comanche natives who could've easily sustained their own movie independent of The Predator and make for an engaging mashup with the established monster much as they did with the characters in the first and second films. Amber Midthunder is our lead Naru and she's really good in the film as she's capable in the fight scenes but also is very green which helps sell the rougher edge to the fight scenes which include some of the clumsiness you'd expect from such skirmishes. The other actors are solid performers and lend themselves to some entertaining and very brutal sequences in the film, including a sequence in the third act which had a nice nod to the ending of Predator 2. The Predator design is really unique featuring a cruder version of the helmet that more resembles a skull than the one we're used to and it works in context. We also get a solid dog character in Sarii who's pretty much a co-lead in the film and they're every bit the character you'd expect from a human actor.\n\nPrey is solid genre fare in its own right, but it also brings the Predator series back on track after getting derailed with the mess of 2018's The Predator.

The inherently alluring paradox of the swashbuckling kitty from the \""Shrek\"" universe remains firmly in place 11 years after his first solo feature. He's a dashing adventurer, a charmer with the ladies, feared and renowned throughout the land -- but he's also unbearably adorable as he laps up milk from a shot glass with his pinky, sandpapery tongue. As always, the charismatic and sensitive Antonio Banderas finds just the right tone in exploring this furry animated figure's suave and silly sides. \""The Last Wish\"" expands the roster of ridiculously talented supporting players from the Oscar-nominated 2011 original \""Puss in Boots.\"" Joining Banderas and his longtime friend and co-star Salma Hayek Pinault are Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, and John Mulaney, among many others. They bring a surprising amount of substance to what might have been a purely playful endeavor. But of course, the fast-paced humor and elaborate visuals are the main draws of director Joel Crawford and co-director Januel Mercado's film. The film's aesthetics may rely too heavily on anime influences, especially during the action sequences, but the vibrant colors and rich textures are a delight.

No, I'm not talking about Akira Kurosawa's Japanese flick from 1963, but I'm talking about SS Rajamouli's RRR. Actually, that's the best brief for the film I can think of. SS Rajamouli has been making mass-friendly commercial films for a long time, but Bahubali brought him pan-India popularity. He became a household name and a BRAND! So naturally, anything he would do after Bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too. The same happened with Prabhas when he came after Bahubali with \""Saaho\"" and \""Radhe Shyam\"". Let's just accept the fact that a film like \""Bahubali : The Conclusion\"" (2017) can't be made again and again. Not just because it was a Massive Blockbuster, but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays. When I saw Bahubali 2, I called it the Greatest Commercial Entertainer of this millennium after Gadar (2001). Surprisingly, these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore+ tickets in the Hindi belt. It was acceptable to see such heroic characters in Bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period, which makes it reasonable. But with RRR, it can't be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century, where you expect some humanly possible stuff. It doesn't matter how big (fictionally) your character is, it has to make some sense when it comes to on-screen persona, as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period, who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood, and it all came with human restrictions. RRR looks problematic in that sense, but if you talk about mass cinema, then RRR is simply phenomenal.\n\nRRR is a fictional tale set in the 1920s. Two Indian revolutionaries, Rama Raju (Ram Charan) and Komaram Bheem (Jr. NTR), try to fight the mighty British Empire and Nizam of Hyderabad in their own ways, which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other. Bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by British officer Steve (Ray Stevenson) and his wife, Lady Scott (Alison Doody), while Rama is a British cop who tries to stop him. Two powerful heroes, one fiRe and one wateR, are pitted against each other, and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past events.\n\nRRR presents Ram Charan and Jr. NTR in never-seen-before avatars. Rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls. Ram Charan enters with a 5-minute long action scene, which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind, but that's what \""mass cinema\"" means, right? On the other hand, Jr. NTR has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too. That entire forest sequence will blow your mind. A good happy warning to all Tarak fans: please keep your expectations high because Bheem is going to exceed all of them. The pair of Rama and Bheem work like a fireworks display during all those large-scale action sequences. Talking about the supporting cast, especially two Hindi actors, Ajay Devgn and Alia Bhatt, both have small but important cameos. Ajay Devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again, and in other news, the sky is blue. This man has some charisma of his own. It's only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly. Alia Bhatt as Sita looks gorgeous in every single scene, and her character plays a vital part in the narrative. Olivia Morris sparkles the screen with her beauty, and her accent is too cute. Alison Doody is the exact opposite of that, but that's what the villainous characters do. Both Samuthirakani and Shriya Saran appear in small roles, and both pass with good grades.\n\nRRR's basic script is as good as any Telugu action drama (mind you, some call it mindless), but the screenplay doesn't match that certain level you are expecting. The second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too. All those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the Big-screen extravaganza in 3D. The action sequences of RRR have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in India. Rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done Bahubali. That film still had battlefield references to help a bit, but RRR, despite being driven by two characters, provides a better visual spectacle than Bahubali. That's not a small thing, mind you. The music of RRR is going to create some hysteria in theatres. If you don't feel like dancing while \""Naacho Naacho,\"" I'd say please consult a doctor. You are not normal. \""Dosti\"" has got nice tunes for a situational song, and \""Komuram Bheemudo\"" will take you all by surprise. I'm not sure if you can hear \""Raamam Raaghavam\"" clearly because there will be a lot of noise, including big screams and whistles, going around at the time. But you'll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching home.\n\nIt's been more than two years since we haven't had a big pan-India event film and SS Rajamouli brings back that much needed \""Big-Screen Experience\"" for us. Undoubtedly, the best director in India when it comes to commercial cinema. The name is SS Rajamouli! His extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in India. Bahubali was an ordinary script, but it's Rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film. No matter how many resemblances you find between it and \""The Lion King\"" or its original source material, Shakespeare's Hamlet, it's a story every Indian can relate to. That's the same case with RRR, despite some flaws in the writing. But that's where Rajamouli's genius mind works overtime. He presents the high-octane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy. The hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too. Whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that pre-interval rampage or even that mind-boggling climax in the forest, SS Rajamouli has outdone himself. He has reached a level that other commercial directors in Indian cinema can never reach or even dream about. Give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it. That's what he has done with RRR. Every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas. Every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him. As a whole, RRR packs a solid punch of out-and-out commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the Bahubali juggernaut.

It took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film RRR, shoot and bring it to the silver screen. Pulling off a multi-starrer with Jr NTR and Ram Charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself. But Rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the story.\n\nRRR is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries - Alluri Seetharama Raju who waged an armed campaign against the British and Komaram Bheem a tribal from the Gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people. There is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but Rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meeting.\n\nRRR runs on a relatively simple premise. There's 'fire' - an angry, young police officer Ramaraju (Ram Charan) who is both revered and feared by the British. He has done their every bidding for years, he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet, he is the one who's never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin. Then there's 'water' - sweet, simple, innocent Bheem (Jr NTR) who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose. He's a Gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called Malli, who was taken away by Lady Scott (Alison Doody), to be the singing doll 'on (her) mantelpiece'. But that is just the beginning of the tale.\n\nRajamouli's new calling cards seem to be building new world. Because, despite being based on two revolutionaries from history, RRR has a story that's completely fictional. Delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas. Bheem might have fought against the Nizams, so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the British that he's not to be taken lightly. But he also finds shelter with Muslims in Delhi. Ramaraju might seem like a well-trained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle (Samuthirakani) knows about. Scott (Ray Stevenson) might believe 'brown rubbish' deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but Jennifer (Olivia Morris) seems more empathetic. This is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek, this is the one where you use your hands as weapons.\n\nThe first half of RRR runs like clockwork. There's the emotional core in Malli, there's the song and dance with Naatu Naatu (it'll make you smile) and a friendship explored through Dosti, there's even a few laughs whenever Bheem tries to befriend Jennifer. Cinematic liberties are taken but they don't seem as noticable as in the later portions, half where the film falters a bit. The way Ramaraju's fiancé Sita (Alia Bhatt) is woven into the narrative, apart from Ram Charan's transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing. After the way Bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told, the way Ramaraju's story unfolds seems strained. The climax leaves more to be desired. The good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you. Rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverly.\n\nNone-the-less Rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for - a commercial, action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained - which it does. The length also doesn't prove to be a hindrance, thanks to a tight screenplay. The VFX in certain portions could've been better. Jr NTR pulls off his career's best performance. He's charming as Bheem, especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find Malli comes through well, so does his love for Ramaraju. Ram Charan also does well, pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through. Tarak and Charan's roles require them to have chemistry, which they do. Alia Bhatt, Olivia Morris, Samuthirakani, Ajay Devgn, Shriya Saran and others play their parts well. Olivia in particular manages to win your heart. Alison and Ray breeze through their roles. Keeravani's OST for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the BGM. Senthil's camerawork is a delight too.\n\nRRR is made for a big screen viewing. The cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner. Oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from Rajamouli now. The background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition, unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself. It numbs us into submission but post-interval as the pace falters a little, the pleasures dwindle too.\n\nRRR is perfection by any means because after the way Rajamouli pulls off certain scenes, you wonder if he could've done a better job in others. But watch this one this weekend if you've been longing for a good action packed drama.

My question is why?\n\nI'm not familiar at all with Tollywood/Bollywood movies. This was the first one I've seen all the way through. But prior to watching RRR, I was familiar with all of the Bollywood clichés and have seen numerous infamous clips on YouTube. They're all very over the top with their presentation and acting, they're all very long, and they all include several dance/musical numbers. But I figured since this was the first Tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie, something that stood out and there really isn't.\n\nAs I was watching RRR I thought to myself, what if this was an American film and it featured the same story, the same action scenes, and the same length? I would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated, too tonally inconsistent, having bad CGI effects, terrible pacing, underdeveloped romantic subplots, and one-dimensional villains. But I guess since this is a Tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine? Do they add to the charm of this film? I don't know but I'm honestly low-key baffled by the reception that RRR is getting.\n\nAnd I'm also baffled by how this Tollywood film looks just like every other Indian action film that has come out for the past several years. Seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other Indian blockbusters?\n\nHere are a few positives I can give this film. There is some nice direction and cinematography, both of the lead actors have good chemistry, some of the action scenes are fun (some are also completely stupid) and sometimes the score is good (and sometimes it's not and very random). Clearly, Indian blockbuster films are just not for me, I'll acknowledge that.

The way the whole thing has been set up, how both the screenplay and the narrative make use of the surroundings to uplift the anxiety; it's exceptional, out of this world! And I'm not even exaggerating, the initial half of this film alone set a pretty good example of how aviation stories must be written and carried out, and that too in an effective manner.\n\nAs far as the latter half is concerned, it is mostly dialogue-oriented with little to no room for elements of suspense or thrill.

All of the action scenes are screaming for an unrestricted R-rating. I saw a similar thing with Netflix's The Gray Man. It's a much better movie but should have definitely been rated R.\n\nThe difference is, The Gray Man did a great job of hiding the restrictions on violence, strategically with camera angles and edits. Samaritan doesn't try to hide it at all. There are scenes of brutal violence with zero blood. A throat is slit... with ZERO blood. It makes the movie feel amateur.\n\nWe keep seeing examples like this, like Morbius, a vampire movie without blood. I don't know when they're going to learn that this is a terrible strategy. PG-13 supposedly sells more tickets, but a good rated R movie is going to be more successful than a bad PG-13 movie.\n\nBut... this is a streaming movie with, to my knowledge, no theatrical showings.

It was charming, well-acted and coherent, so it was also simply well-written. The first two sequels were good sequels that were fun, managed to keep a lot of the charm of the original and played a game with the endless sequels that were made in that period of horror classics and today have their very peculiar, but quite nice pop cultural value. The last part of the grand master came years later. \""Scream 4\"" (2011) was not quite in the jolt of the original, and incidentally designed as such, trilogy, but was still entertaining and the signature of the director was still noticeable and valuable. Seven years after Wes Craven's death, the franchise is now being driven to the wall by insanely arrogant film producers and the woke age along with its concomitants of lack of respect and lack of originality of its own.\n\nBut from the beginning. The new Scream film claims to be a \""Requel\"", as it also certainly does not forget to mention permanently in the film in clumsy reference to the self-irony of the original. A \""Requel\"", we are instructed in the film, is a mixture of a sequel and a remake. So far so good, but more on that later.\n\nThe film actually begins in the classic Scream style and fulfills the one pole of the remake quite alright: an initial murder, which however remains only a murder attempt, the establishment of a circle of friends, (apparent) love for horror films and slasher moments, which now already obviously should not come up short. Then the other pole of a \""Requel\"" comes into play: Connections to the previous parts are built up, old characters are introduced and the myth is dug into as if one were a mole. So it comes out that apparently everything revolves around the previously unknown child of Loomis, one of the two killers from the first part. A classic movie flow is unwound, with allusions to the horror movie world, a classic story progression, and even painfully foreseeable plot developments. As I said, so far so good.\n\nAs a viewer, you realize that while the weakest film in the series is taking place before your very eyes here, you still don't get the impression that this part was actually going to be particularly bad either. But to err is human, and trusting modern Hollywood productions is about as appropriate for one's health as stabbing one's heart with a long kitchen knife. The finale of the film should become the confirmation of this thesis and concomitantly the destruction of the preceding 85 minutes. Here the filmmakers, i.e. Screenwriters, directors and producers, seem to have succumbed to a premonition that their film would fail. But this lack of self-confidence on the part of the uncreative rascals was simply passed off, and such a thing is increasingly easy to do these days, in an age of wokeness, the desire for dead discourse, and the lack of ability for one's own self-criticism. Once again, the fans of the original and its successors were identified as the world devourers of modern cinematic art, i.e. Those who always raised a franchise to the Everest that today's uncreative filmmakers keep trying to blow up.\n\nThe finale of \""Scream\"" (2022) pursues the thesis that those fans are always the branches in the gears of the bicycle ridden by the well-heeled and only ever demanding Hollywood aristocrats of today. Those fans who make up the very largest part of a potential audience, and who so far seem to have only made the mistake of passionately liking a franchise. The \""Scream\"" franchise is one such franchise that has been kept alive by such fans, fans who are now portrayed as potentially insane murderers in this new installment. At the same time, they are still too dumb to understand modern movies, such as \""The Babadook\"" (2014), and the derivation for this is that they - watch out, cleverness afoot - are into movies like \""Scream\"" (1996), i.e. Those stupid and bad horror movies.\n\nThis is admittedly explained in a - attention - \""Requel\"" by just such a luminary of that time. Well, thank you!\n\nThe whole thing could have been made humorous and more all-encompassing, perhaps in such a way that modern Woke society gets at least a bit of fat in a reflected way - then you could have taken it self-ironic - but one-sided moralizing of people, the basic ideas of democracy, discussion and the freedom of art is no fun. It's only through the finale that small points in the film that you could have simply overlooked before also start to bother you, but in the retrospective, i.e. After the final viewing of the film, this no longer seems possible. The disrespectful treatment of Dewey (David Arquette), for example, the clumsy man-bashing, i.e. The right-around variant of sexism in the 21st century, and a half-dozen other pandering to a Twitter community, which is 90% sure not a dollar for a tickets to see this film are simply too much of a bad thing. In the end, postulating that the film was made \""For Wes\"" is probably no longer just questionable after having constantly ridiculed one's craft.\n\nThose responsible should be ashamed of this film, but since shame obviously hardly seems to be a thing these days, that's not to be expected either way. Just as little as good counter-arguments from those who refuse to communicate and the modern Lancelots of discourse killers. In such a structure one does not need to mention any names. As is well known, fans of 90s horror wrote them on murder slips anyway and exchange them full of hatred in forums in order to throw branches that break the neck of modern film art into the bicycle spokes. Irony off. But irony also seems to be one of those great things that are almost completely lost these days, so what the heck.\n\nArrogant, stupid and certainly without such \""unfashionable\"" values as respect and discourse skills."", ""Upvotes"": ""275"", ""Downvotes"": ""170"", ""Reviewer"": ""patrickfilbeck""}, {""Title"": ""Elevated slasher"", ""Rating"": ""8"", ""Review Content"": ""Right off the bat I have to say, this is about as perfect of a sequel as I can remember.

My Rating 10/10\n\nThis is a very important movie that will probably suffer at the box office as evidenced by poor attendance early in it's initial theatrical release.\n\nIt's based on the 2019 book of the same name by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey two persistent and brave journalists who took on the ugly spectre of the once most powerful man in Hollywood Harvey Weinstein.\n\nIt's probably no coincidence that Carey Mulligan who was also superb as Maud Watts another pioneer for women's rights in the 2015 movie Suffragette was cast as Megan Twohey who along with Zoe Kazan who's equally impressive as Jodi Kantor ,they both have a place in journalistic history .\n\nI think these two impressive investigative journalists will be seen to be as important in the history of women's rights as the 1912 suffragettes in London who also battled powerful men who thought women should be silenced and remain subservient in a male dominated system.\n\nShe Said is a much much bigger story than the pursuit and eventual conviction of Harvey Weinstein who is currently serving 23 years in prison and interestingly at the time of this movie's release is facing more charges of sexual assault in L. A. In one of the many powerful scenes in the film Megan Twohey says to her colleague Jodi Kantor words to the effect that this is much more than nailing Weinstein .\n\nIt's not just him we should be after. They have an entire machine What we're dealing with here is a system that condones sexual abuse to women by men in powerful positions.\n\nIf it could happen to Hollywood actresses, who else is it happening to?\n\nThat's the reason I think this movie is one of the most important films of the year .\n\nBeautifully directed by Maria Schrader with a screenplay by Rebecca Lenkiewicz that's intense if perhaps a little slow in gaining momentum but when it does it soars .\n\nThere's so many great performances in She Said , special mention must be made about Patricia Clarkson as Rebecca Corbett the executive editor who encourages and supports the two journalists and Jennifer Ehle as Laura Madden a woman facing a life threatening health crisis .\n\nLaura's story which begins the movie when she is a young woman on a film set in Ireland in 1995 . It concerns the sexual abuse perpetrated by Weinstein that she has felt shamed for and hidden from her family till this investigation .\n\nThere are to many other great performances to mention including Ashley Judd who played such an important role in the exposure of Weinstein's crimes she of course plays herself .\n\nI think this is why this film has an authenticity about it including the fact that the movie was shot in the real New York Times building and is the first movie ever to use the real offices.\n\nIt was interesting and a little surprising to see Brad Pitt's name on the credits as an Executive Producer of this movie . When he was dating Gwyneth Paltrow decades before his marriage to Angelina Jolie he was aware of the sexual harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein .\n\nHe also purchased the rights to the book on which this movie is based on.\n\nGwyneth Paltrow who is often mentioned but not seen in the movie told him about her encounters with Weinstein which occurred at the very beginning of her career according to her interview on the Howard Stern Show on May 23, 2018.\n\nIn 2009, Pitt starred in Inglourious Basterds (2009), which was produced by Weinstein and distributed by The Weinstein Company, and a few years later he approached Weinstein and asked him to produce the movie Killing Them Softly (2012) . Angelina Jolie who was also a victim of Weinstein's abuse said in an interview for The Guardian on September 4, 2021, that she fought with Pitt over that, but he still wanted Weinstein to produce the movie anyway, and Jolie said that it hurt her that Pitt was happy to work with Weinstein despite knowing he had assaulted her.\n\nI really hope my review prompts more people to see She Said in a cinema preferably as it is obvious from the early Trump reference regarding his sexual misconduct allegations with audio evidence to back it up that these powerful men still have a powerful protection machine behind them .\n\nWeinstein's great protector amazingly was a woman Lisa Bloom an attorney who tried to discredit the journalists and the women who came forward .\n\nOne of the most notable trends to emerge from the 2016 presidential election was the large number of white women who helped solidify Donald Trump's victory.\n\nHopefully this trend has turned around the Trump phone call in the early scenes of She Said sets the plot for a disturbing and very educational movie experience."", ""Upvotes"": ""60"", ""Downvotes"": ""61"", ""Reviewer"": ""tm-sheehan""}, {""Title"": ""The size of the shark matters."", ""Rating"": ""8"", ""Review Content"": ""Sometimes a movie is a record of events, a record of the truth, which lifts its importance higher than mere entertainment. There have been some notable films about real events, history changing events, and beyond the independently high value of each film, none have come close to All the President's Men (1976).\n\nThere comes a moment in every film about journalism, that the size of the shark is revealed. In All the President's Men it is towards the end: \""everyone is involved (...) your lives are in danger\"". In Spotlight (2015) it's when they realize the number of abusive priests, in Boston alone, is not five or six but over ninety. In She Said (2022) the size of the shark is revealed at the historical notes just before the end credits.\n\nShe Said, may not be about a crook of a US President or the systemic cover-up of abuse by the Catholic church, but it is about something that reaches far and wide in every corner of life and of the workplace: the abuse of women and the abusers' standard defense that the victims are making it up, and then paying them off for their silence.\n\nAlthough the pace of the movie is slow and low key, like any investigative journalism is in real life, I would have wanted a few points of punctuation where we instantly realize we are going to need a bigger boat. Yes, such real-life points have been accurately transferred to the screen in She Said, but you have to look for them, they don't jump out at you, and if you are already sleeping you might miss them. This admittedly very well-made movie could do with a little more catering to audiences that need to be pinched awake once in a reel or so.\n\nFor years now I have stopped re-watching Weinstein's excellent movies because they were made by a despicable creature who hurt human beings while making these excellent movies. No Weinstein re-runs for me. And kudos to the New York Times investigative reporters and to the New York Times for going after a world-renowned film producer and, in the beginning of the movie, going after a presidential candidate.

The film depicts decades-old sexism, but this time we have a modern story of a famous celebrity. Frankly speaking, the story had a bigger scope to spread its wings since it is very much a feminist story, but somewhere, the cinematic majesty is missing. The entire journalism angle looked outdated and tedious since I have already seen better classics like \""All The President's Men\"" (1976) and \""Spotlight\"" (2015). I deliberately avoided mentioning \""Network\"" (1976), as it is more about filthy journalism than honest journalism. Okay, so She Said had all those positive qualities such as honesty, dedication, fighting against bad and raising voice against crimes, etc., but what's new there? Since we have read enough about Weinstein already, there is no way this film can offer you anything different and important unless you enjoy fiction or cinematic liberty more than the film itself.\n\nThe film is based on the noble work done by two New York Times journalists, Megan Twohey (Carey Mulligan) and Jodi Kantor (Zeo Kazan). While searching for a feature story on a sensitive issue like sexual abuse at the workplace, Twohey and Kantor discover Harvey Weinstein's wrongdoings that haven't been taken seriously. Weinstein's crimes have never been reported, or filled legally on a high level when reported; hence, the voices against him are either mute or out of network. Twohey and Kantor team up and get into deep study, searching, and documentation of the same, while several facts leave them shattered during their investigation. She Said is all about their constant efforts to find proof against the culprits and raise their voice against women's abuse at the workplace or, for that matter, anywhere else.\n\nShe Said is an authentic script, despite a few fictional elements, but the screenplay is a big letdown. It just doesn't hold you or your attention long enough. So we know that they are investigating and are supposed to meet women, hear about their experiences, and get them on record to teach a lesson to the culprit. But where's the unique storytelling here? The screenplay is so dragged out and poorly written that you feel like skipping the rest of the show and reading the book to know the results immediately. Having a slow pace is not a problem here; the problem is missing out on the drama and cinematic arrangements of an engaging thriller. She Said takes too much time to say things that you already know, so the question is, why did she actually say it?\n\nCarey Mulligan's performance is pretty good as she portrays Megan's part. The other lady, Zoe Kazan as Jodi, leaves you impressed in some scenes. The crying ones aren't the reason to say this, but the way it has been executed on screen is. Andre Braugher's Dean will remind you of your boss (if you are working in the media field, like me). The supporting cast of Patricia Clarkson, Jennifer Ehle, Samantha Morton, Ashley Judd, Sean Cullen, Tom Pelphrey, Adam Shapiro, and Anastasia Barzee adds more to the acting room as a big happy unit. The characters may look slightly off trajectory sometimes, but it's not their mistake if all they did was just follow the orders.\n\nDear Natasha Braier, Why were some frames looking oversized? A couple of times the subtitles were cropped out of the frame? Was that the original print or was there a projection issue in our theatre during the screening? She Said also suffers due to poor support from all the technical departments, be it cinematography, background score, editing, sound design, or production design. Maria Schrader's choice of story was not great in the first place. I don't know why anyone would be interested in watching Harvey Weinstein's story, which has already been published in the newspapers and has less dramatic values. Even I myself didn't know his name except for \""Shakespeare in Love\"" (1998), \""Malèna\"" (2000), and \""Gangs of New York\"" (2002). Yes, I agree that the sorry needed to be told, but I think feature film is not the right medium for it. A web series narrative or an OTT release with docudrama stuff would have fit better. Maria's biographical drama lacks high-end drama, emotions, brutality, and verbally powerful speeches on social awareness. If you still wanna go over it, just prepare yourself for a slow-paced but steady feminist docudrama.\n\nRATING - 5/10*"", ""Upvotes"": ""42"", ""Downvotes"": ""62"", ""Reviewer"": ""SAMTHEBESTEST""}]"

However the three soon discover they're not alone as a masked killer begins terrorizing them with their secluded hideaway now isolating them from help.\n\nSick is the latest film from Scream writer and creator Kevin Williamson and director John Hyams. Williamson's inspiration for Sick came about during the pandemic where noticing the isolation and effects thereof thought it could be put to good use for a horror film. Alongside Williamson, the movie is also the screenwriting debut of co-writer Katelyn Crabb who had worked as an assistant to Williamson on the 2022 Scream. Now debuting on Peacock, I'm happy to say that Sick is a solidly entertaining time with bloody fun and Williamson's trademark sense of humor.\n\nThe movie does a good job of setting itself up with an opening kill sequence featuring Joel Courtney's Tyler that establishes the early days of Covid going through a grocery store and despite plenty of people in the store it's a very isolating experience as Tyler walks through the aisles inundating with vaguely sinister text messages on his phone. While there've been plenty of Covid films only a few have really stuck out as legitimately good such as KIMI or Glass Onion while others such as Songbird or The Bubble were not, I'm happy to say that Sick is closer to the level of the former than the latter. Once the movie gets started it doesn't let up and John Hyams does a good job of putting the script to film with some intensely directed attack scenes using a handheld camera and during the lurking scenes Hyams doesn't use ANY orchestral stings or jump scares and instead opts for creeping dread to build fear and tension. In many ways I was reminded of that Mike Flanagan film Hush from a few years ago that much like Sick was a minimalist slasher film in an isolated countryside. I don't think Sick is quite on par with Hush as I wasn't all that hooked with the characters initially and thought the opening with them partying in the house dragged a little bit, but once the action kicked in I did feel like I got to know them a bit more and I was invested in the outcome.\n\nSick is fun, humorous, and quick slasher entertainment that will be a welcome viewing for fans of the genre.

But it makes several mistakes.\n\nIn Scream, the motive of the killer wasn't instantly known, but the theme was. Horror movies. And how to survive one (or more likely not). Here, the killers don't have a theme. We just get an exposition dump just before the final fight. Until then, it's just random black clad killer stabbing people.\n\nScream gave us multiple suspects. Here, there are none except for one obvious red herring.\n\nFinally, the protagonist:\n\nScream's Sidney Prescott was immensely likeable. So much so, that she carried 5 movies. Usually it's the killers (Jason, Freddy etc) who carry a horror franchise, but Neve Campbell absolutely made the series her own.\n\nThe acting is mostly bad as well. Slasher movies need charismatic and relatable leads, who we - the audience - want to survive. Here we get a spoiled, selfish brat. Her friend, the black girl, is not only written as a smarter character (because of course she is, it's the 2020s) who is more knowledgible and emotionally mature and doesn't play with people's emotions, but the actress is also far better and more charistmatic. So we're stuck with a main character (the audience avatar) who's an unlikeable jerk and makes stupid decisions. Way to not keep your audience invested.\n\nThe overacting by the killers is laughable, and the movie becomes a farce once they tie a character down and subject them to a terrible exposition dump about their motive. At least that's something the audience can relate to at that point. Except we're not forced to listen, we can fast forward to the final kill, which ends up being marred by the worst cgi since She Hulk.\n\nThey couldn't even afford a measly fire suit for that stunt and had to use an some after effects overlay.\n\nWay to give the middle finger to whatever part of the audience stuck around until the end. That's like a restaurant throwing you a stale candy bar on the table for dessert.\n\nThe covid theme feels tacked on and is more distracting than anything else.

His long-feature debut \""Rare Exports\"" was one of the most uniquely original and pleasantly deranged horror tales of the new century, and even his somewhat commercialized breakthrough \""Big Game\"" (starring Samuel L. Jackson as the US President crashing with Air Force One in the Finnish woods) was a lot better and more entertaining than you'd think as well.\n\nIt took Helander nearly 8 years to return with a new film. At the Brussels' International Film Festival, where \""Sisu\"" premiered and Helander was a guest of honor, he explained that he spent several years working on a personal dream project of his, but unfortunately it got cancelled entirely due to Covid. Out of pure frustration, or so he says, Helander wrote the script for \""Sisu\"" in barely a couple of weeks. Well, if this near-brilliant explosion of action and sheer adrenalin is what he comes up with in a few weeks, then I sincerely hope he'll still get the chance to finish his other project.\n\nWhat a film! You know those movies where all the great highlights and action-packed moments already feature in the trailer? \""Sisu\"" has a terrific trailer too, but there are still a few hundreds of other highlights left to discover in the film. In fact, this film is a one-and-a-half-hour trailer full of awesome moments. The comparisons I've read between \""Sisu\"" and Quentin Tarantino's \""Inglourious Bastards\"" are accurate. The extreme violence and narrative structure are identical, and both films feature lots and lots of Nazis getting killed. Everybody just loves watching Nazis getting butchered in the utmost brutal and sadistic ways, is it not?\n\nAatami Korpi is a lone hermit digging for gold in the most northern region of Finland during the last months of WWII. When he hits the jackpot, he loads up his bag with pure gold and hopes to keep a low profile while heading back to civilization. When a platoon of Nazis finds out what he's carrying, though, they obviously want to steal it. But Korpi is not just a weak and defenseless recluse, or what did you expect? He's a force so determined and indestructible that only an obscure and local Finnish term for him exists.\n\nEvidently (and also similar to \""Inglourious Bastards\""), \""Sisu\"" requires quite some suspension of disbelief from the audience. This man has the fighting and survival skills of John Rambo, but in combination with the indestructability of a T-1000 Terminator! Whether shot at with heavy artillery or a rope, he cannot die.

I wasn't expecting some 11-time Oscar winning masterpiece, but I did expect an intense, edge-of-your-seat scarefest like that of 'Insidious' or 'Sinister', where the movie is dripping with creepy unsettlingness from start to finish. 'Smile' is not that. What 'Smile' does well is build up the jump scare, but unfortunately (and more importantly), 'Smile' forgets to deliver the scare in each of these sequences it repeats throughout its way overlong 2-hour runtime.\n\nExample, the main character will be staring down a dark hallway while the music tenses and camera slowly zooms in, and then the phone will ring SO LOUD. This is NOT a scare! This is just lazy and, above all, annoying. These \""jump scares\"" happen throughout the ENTIRE movie and are extremely obnoxious. I can respect jump scares if there's actually something scary at the end of the build-up, not just an obnoxiously loud noise that has nothing to do with the tension that was just wasted. An example of an ACTUAL jump scare would be like when the Lipstick Demon appears at the table for the first time in 'Insidious'. THAT is a warranted jump scare.\n\nThe plot of 'Smile' and the way the characters unravel it is almost identical to 'The Ring'. No new ground is broken, which was expected, but I at least expected a little more originality than a copy/paste story of 'The Ring' with a good amount of 'It Follows' copied as well, yet is far less than both those movies.\n\nWhat I thought was pretty good was the ending, when the demon finally reveals itself. The design of the demon and what it does to its victims is actually pretty great/gruesome. Unfortunately, by the time we're introduced to the Smile demon, the movie's over. Such a shame, as this movie could have been a balls-to-the-wall nail-biting chiller. The score for this movie was hands-down the best and creepiest part. The music reminded me of 'Sinister's music, as in there was something off about it, making it unnerving.\n\nOverall, this movie has been done before and done MUCH better.

Why? Because it immediately gives us all that we need to get into the context of the film, not only in terms of the most classic horror elements but also in terms of its main themes. All this before its title card. But how? Introducing us immediately to our main character, Dr Rose Cotter, who works in a psychiatric hospital and who receives a visit from a new patient who in ten minutes shows strange behaviour, claims to be being followed by an evil entity, smiles scarily and commits suicide. And now that curse seems to have passed on to our Dr., who is impeccably played by Sosie Bacon, in one of those roles where she often has to balance herself on the boundary that separates what everyone sees and what only she can see.\n\nTrauma. It will always be traumatic to witness an event as dramatic and violent as a suicide. And it is from trauma that this entity feeds. And how well this theme is used... after all, many of us have gone through traumas and traumas are just kept in a hidden corner within us, always ready to be reactivated. Grief and guilt are often associated with traumatic events, and Smile does not deny that connection. Nor does it refuse to make connections with psychological and mental problems that can arise from it and how when this happens, the victim becomes even more placed on the sidelines, more isolated, more alone in a world from which one does not intend to move away but from which finds no other alternative.\n\nBut of course, this is a horror movie and it's not only about the message that a film of the genre should live. Good news: even if you don't care about meaning, Smile is pretty good and effective entertainment. The suspenseful scenes are very well constructed, the environment feels heavy for long moments and it presents us with several jump scares that work perfectly, being this one of the scariest films of recent years.\n\nThe film suffers from a certain predictability typical of the genre - I saw that ending coming from miles away - and, at times, it seems to rely a little too much on the power of suggestion and the effectiveness of its scares, although there are reasons for that because those are two areas where it stands out. The visual effects - mostly practical - are not present for long moments, but when they appear they elevate the work, with some really terrifying images. And as for Parker Finn...what a great movie debut, not only because of the way he leaves us on edge thanks to a very safe direction but also for presenting some elements that we don't often see in horror in terms of the originality of shots and scene transitions.\n\n2022 doesn't stop giving us good horror.

He always delivers on beautiful animation and an interesting fantasy story and Suzume delvers on that. There are a few things I didn't like, some things I loved but overall I felt this to be a bit on the bland side. This story felt already told by Shinkai and while I always want to watch what he dose next, I always hope he´ll push himself just a little bit more to do something different. He still delivers a charming and moving movie here, but the impact wasn't really there this time for me.\n\nAfter following a young man to the ruins near her town, Suzume accidently awakens a demon thar protected the world from an evil that creates earthquakes. Suzume most now help Souta who has been hexed into a chair save Japan.\n\nI really love the characters in this movie. They all feel alive and independent. The movie has this road trip vibe where Suzume meets more people and see more of Japan, and every person feels like their own, even if they barely impact the story. Suzume is a character that needed more time to really shine and shown the way she feels and why she acts the way she dose but to me the creative and weird decision of turning Souta into a chair that can walk and talk is a stroke of genius. It makes the story more memorable and really shows the magical capabilities of this world. And the chair is cute no doubt.\n\nWhat Shinkai often do best is the mix of serious and real with magic and fantasy. This movie can be seen as a fun fantasy road trip, or a look at the abandon culture of Japan as well as the horror of earthquakes. The movie is kids fun, while talking about orphans and even mentioning the 3/11 earthquake and tsunami, showing it in a moving and gut wrenching way. This is where Shinkai shines, and this movie moved me to tears at the end. It has this very impactful scene with a kid calling for her mom and it really is devastating. The very end is kind of just there and while interesting doesn't really impact the story too much. In general it feels like the movie was written by multiple people with multiple visions and too much they wanted to say, but there is only 1 writing credit, Skinkai himself. I think he wanted to do too many things this time around and the middle of the movie really slows down to me and some plot points only shine in one scene and is then abandoned. The story also felt like something I had seen before and the hopeless romanticism of Shinkai feels done to death now. It had Weathering with you (2019) vibes, another Shinkai movie, and the plot points were a bit too similar to me. It´s still a good story, but I would love to see Shinkai move out of his comfort zone.\n\nThe animation is as always absolutely glorious and incredible. Shinkai has this eye for the small and mundane which he always but energy into as the side of an eraser that is highly detailed with logos and text. Not only the but there are these just picturesque frames that are so beautiful and detailed. Shinkai has been experimenting more and more with the crossing of 2D and 3D animation and now I feel like he is leaning more into 3D. This is for better and worse as the 3D looks incredible and some frames are still absolutely stunning, but I miss his 2D charm. It´s still here, but a bit more in the background comparably.\n\nThe score and music is pretty good and cute, not as memorable as it used to be but it works for this movie.\n\nThe voice acting is pretty good too and especially love Suzume´s voice actress Hanoka Hara. She brings so much natural voice work to her role and her acting is effortless. While I am not criticizing Souta´s voice work, I noticed his voice sounded recorded. You could really hear it was recorded sound and it created this cheap and unnatural sound to the character.\n\nSuzume is a good movie and I can´t wait to watch it again, but it will take a bit longer for me to return to this compared to Shinkais other works. This movie just lagged a little bit everywhere and while still being enjoyable it just isn't as perfect as I´m used to from this director."", ""Upvotes"": ""74"", ""Downvotes"": ""30"", ""Reviewer"": ""mickeythechamp""}, {""Title"": ""Amazing movie, Shinkai's best!!"", ""Rating"": ""10"", ""Review Content"": ""I just got to see Suzume at the NYC premiere and it's definitely Makoto Shinkai's best so far.

Because if I talk about the problems I had with the movie, it seems a bit unfair because it is in fact a good movie. But if I don't, that seems unfair too because I did have some problems with this movie. Here's a little background on my impression of the director (and the writer and the editor) - Makoto Shinkai. \""Your Name\"" is one of the best movies I've ever seen (not just in anime). And I absolutely adore \""5 Centimetres Per Second\"" and \""Garden of Words\"". I sort of have a love-hate relationship with \""Weathering With You\"". I can write a long paragraph about it, but long story short, I absolutely love the direction, animation and soundtrack of that movie, but I really don't like the script and the plot.\n\nOk now to Suzume. I do think this is a good movie. And I think people are going to have a great time with it, because of Shinkai's masterful direction and the RADWIMPS' breath-taking soundtrack. But I'm disappointed with the plot. Well, not exactly disappointed, but let me explain a bit more. I had a lot of fun with the first half of this movie. In fact, I loved the first 80% of this movie. And that's also because the movie continuously kept adding more and more unanswered questions, which made the plot more and more mysterious and it was great, until I started realising that the movie doesn't have enough time left to answer all those questions. And it didn't. When the end credits rolled, I was disappointed because so many answers felt missing. So much supernatural stuff happened in between that just wasn't explained. And now that I think about it, even Your Name didn't exactly explain its supernatural stuff. But it worked because of its characters. Because even though those plotlines didn't have a logical reason, they surely had an emotional one. This movie didn't seem to have both. Here, I can see that shinkai is trying to fit these themes like moving on and death but they didn't seem to fit into the movie.\n\nYou know, I can't help but feel that after the success of Your Name, Shinkai is trying to repeat some of the same formulas in his stories. Some similarities with Your Name in both Weathering With You and Suzume are very evident. Like a natural disaster looming over the characters, a romance that turns very dramatic in the second half. The romance in this movie actually felt a lot more natural than it did in Weathering with You. But the problem is that just like Your Name, Shinkai makes these romances take a very dramatic turn. And romance, being a delicate emotion, can't be forced so dramatically until a certain level of familiarity has been reached in the first half.\n\nHe did this flawlessly in Your Name and that's because that movie is built around its romance. Whereas in this movie, it feels that he's trying to add a dramatic romance to a plot that could've done without it. Look that's why it's tough on me, you might think I hated this movie. Not even close. I had a good time with this movie, because it is in fact a good movie. It's just that it could have been a lot more than it is, which is why I have to say the things I said above. But like I said this movie is directed MAJESTICALLY. I mean Shinkai's direction is just insane. He makes you feel emotions that aren't even there to feel xD.\n\nAnd the animation is so, so gorgeous. As good as it was in his previous movies (maybe even better). And RADWIMPS is now 3 in 3 with this soundtrack. This soundtrack is just as good as Your Name and Weathering With You, and that's saying something. I mean there is a sequence, where a certain supernatural entity covers the city of Tokyo and it's like one of the most mesmerizing scenes I've ever seen. The way Shinkai shows that scene, with the breath-taking shots, brilliant animation and jaw-dropping soundtrack, I mean it brought tears to my eyes. Give this man an oscar xD.\n\nThis is also Shinkai's funniest movie. There are some very funny sequences here. 1 specific hilarious plot point that continues throughout the movie was just genius. The movie starts off very quickly and seeing these characters trying to catch on with what all is happening just made it even more entertaining and funny. There are also some very touching moments, mostly because of how brilliantly they were directed. Shinkai's direction and RADWIMPS' soundtrack is a combination that's capable of completely taking over it's viewers. But that 1 part of my brain which was thinking about the plot kept pulling me back.\n\nOverall though I had a good time with this movie but I'd say Shinkai is capable of much more than this in terms of the plot. I certainly like it more than Weathering With You though.\n\nI love movies like 5 Centimetres Per Second and Garden of Words. They were great movies in their own right, and they were nothing like Your Name. Those movies explored deep emotions like separation, alienation and growing up and did it brilliantly. So any movie can be great in its own right.

Replacing the Ouija board with a ceramic hand was a creative and unique touch that the horror genre needs more of, and for that alone this movie deserves some recognition. Creativity and ingenuity are the two elements that the horror genre is sorely lacking, and it's great to see how the new generation is utilizing premises that have been done countless times before and giving them an unexpected spin. That being said, that's about the only thing about this movie that is worth praising.\n\nIf you've ever seen a movie about demonic possession, spirit conjuring, or communicating with the dead via an Ouija board, you've already seen this film. Aside from the method being used, this has been done plenty of times before, and at times I found myself wondering if the people who made this have ever seen a movie in the genre before, because almost every idea was ripped form some other movie. There were so many ways you could have made this movie truly ingenious, but they kept it safe and did the basic \""let's gather a bunch of teens together to communicate with the dead\"" that has already been done TO DEATH so many times. I wish they would have pushed the envelope, going for stuff that was more shocking instead of treading familiar ground. It's what made me ultimately not care much about what transpired in the film.\n\nThe nail on the coffin was the cast, though. Filling a movie with insufferable and unlikable teenagers and young adults completely removed me from the experience. Similar to \""Bodies Bodies Bodies', the cast was a bunch of try-hard teenagers with nasty attitudes, poor behavior and partaking in degenerate behavior that always sits very poorly with me. I'm so glad I neither had friends like any of these people, and that I never had the misfortune of interacting with anyone who behaved this badly in my youth. I believe the movie would have been more effective with an adult cast, but that's just my personal taste.\n\nOverall, a novel concept with mediocre execution makes for a somewhat entertaining film that I didn't regret watching but that I really can't be bothered to recommend. Aside from one scene that was really effective in instilling fear and dread, the rest of the movie is a retread of every Ouija board film you've ever seen.

The plot is pretty basic.... evil and supernatural forces begin to manifest by touching an embalmed hand. I love horror films but I've always treated them like an amusement park ride. They don't need a sophisticated plot but certainly a good screenplay, creepy atmosphere, pacing, uncomfortable tension, and just plain scary. I'll get straight to the pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n\n1. Good cinematography and quality of acting.\n\n2. Because of the lower budget, the film wasn't flooded with CGI. Some of the scenes were pretty creepy. One scene had a dark atmosphere about it that reminded me of a scene from Hereditary.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Way too much filler. I understand and appreciate setting things up for character attachment/development but the first 25-30 min was a snooze fest.\n\n2. Screenplay was too disjointed and had a pacing problem. The scenes involving the hand were good but all the in-between segments with the characters were uninteresting for the most part. At times I was wondering with a particular character if this was horror or a drama.\n\n3. Weak final act. When it's all said and done this movie is about a few entertaining and even scary scenes and a lot of messy writing all over the place. Are they trying too hard? Should they have focused on a different angle if the goal was to make this story deeper? You be the judge. Honestly I think this would have made a really good 12-13 minute short film.\n\nIs this movie on the level of 2018's Hereditary? Heck no. Is it worth watching? Honesty yes.

The screening today was Fright Fest (a festival for horror films), so we all loved it. I would definitely not take anyone squeamish to see this. Art the Clown has a particular thing for harming eyes, probably because he knows that we're particularly squeamish about them. He also plays around with the brains and hearts of his victims. He often kills people just because they're there, even if they've not done anything to offend him.\n\nA common criticism of the first film was that the plot was typical of the slasher genre, with teenage girls in trouble and the goody-two-shoes being the Final Girl. The plot is much better this time. I can tell you what each of the characters was doing with their time, before Art turned up, and there was a good thread on the father of Serena and Jonathan. Knowing that they've lost their father makes you feel sorry for them and want them to succeed. In the first film, part of me thought that it'd be funny for Art the Clown to win, but I really wanted to see him get vanquished in this one.\n\nI have some reservations. It is too long, being about an hour longer than the first film. The supernatural element is also a bit muddled. In \""All Hallows' Eve\"", Art was clearly supernatural. In \""Terrifier\"", you could just about believe that he was human, except for right at the end. In this one, there are supernatural things throughout, but there's never any rules established. I know that film-makers like to keep audiences guessing, but the guessing game is more fun if we have clues to go on.

I wasn't even interested to watch it 'till the end. I would roll my eyes on the animation style, it's not eye-catching nor it is impressive.\n\nBut damnnnnnnn! I wasn't expecting it to be good. It's a feature animated film filled with genuine laughter, comical characters and an above the par plot.\n\nThe caper team consists of Wolf, Tarantula, Piranha, Snake and Shark, all of which play a different archetype from one another. This team of 5 is evil and yet, you might find that their personalities are very likable, charming and even approachable. This is the heart of the film, the element that keeps the audience entertained aside from its narrative.\n\nOcean's 8 meets Zootopia, this is what The Bad Guys is. You may find the first heist somewhat similar to the all-women Ocean's. There's the restrooms, kitchen tray trolleys, red-carpet staircases, hackings (pretty much every heist film), red laser traps, all of which resemble strongly with the mega heist of the Met Gala in the said film. I found TBG better than Zootopia, which I PERSONALLY found it to be overrated. However, those who love Zootopia will also enjoy TBG as it implies similitude to it.\n\nRunning for over 100 minutes, The Bad Guys never stops with its steady pacing, putting audience in an enjoyable ride from start until the end.\n\nLo and behold, you wouldn't expect how many twists they are in this. It's a plot twist on top of another plot twist. Just when you thought, there you go, they have revealed all the twists, the film comes in with another unexpected twist , showing that you have also been deceived by The Bad Guys. When you look back at it, it's amazing that all the twists don't come as a force, but rather it oozes naturally, making it a perfect fit to the whole story.\n\nThe animation style is better than what I had visualized in my mind. Looking at the trailer, I thought it was mehh, but the pencil-like motion drawings got better as time went on. It took a bit of time to adjust but eventually, I liked it.\n\nOn the other side of the cell, I believe that TBG should offer a larger team than mere 5 animals. It would have been so much fun, exciting and the stakes would be even higher!\n\nAll the animal outlaws are excellent however, I must say, I'm a little disappointed with their back stories, because there is almost none to begin with. They did introduce each member in the beginning, but I wanted to know where all of them came from, how they can coexist and walk the earth with humans, and how the group was formed in the first place. I know, I'm aware this is an animated film but what a solid story they could have to an already excellent plot.\n\nRounding up, The Bad Guys is definitely in my top 5 films of 2022 as we almost end the quarter of the year.

Kids will surely love the hasty pace of the film, dazzling you with all the quick paced adventure and comedy that comes with it. Yet, the pace is not breakneck, capable of still giving plenty of time to storytelling and allowing the older audience members to enjoy the movie as well. It really is a fine-balanced movie on this part and wins points for me.\n\nThe Voice Acting: These actors give me chills at what they can pull out of their vocal patterns, and The Bad Guys crew is loaded with wonderful performances that fit the bill quite well. Sam Rockwell nails the lead role well, and I feel he did a great job playing the conflicted \""hero\"" who has a lot of soul searching to find. Marc Maron as Snake is stellar, another loaded gun that has his own turmoil to face, but yet holds the sass and vigor of someone who is ingrained in his ways. The two feel very much like the best friends they portray, and I love the ribbing and vigor they have. As for Awkwafina, a bit more of the prop character, the actress normally loaded with comedy craziness, was actually toned down and respectable, still not too out of her comfort zone, but a much more well-rounded performance. Others hit their marks quite well, and if I had more room, I would go into everyone, but the chemistry between them all is fantastic and really a solid pillar to which this group works.\n\nThe Character Balance: You've got at least five characters to work into a crime/comedy, and that's not counting a few other characters that have their own involvement in the film. And like a good book, this film does it super well with the characters that they promoted. Each of the animals may not have all the equal time, but they stand out in unique ways, bring their gifts to the table, and provide a meaningful contribution to the film. You, and the younger audiences, will find a character that they absolutely enjoy, and you will get your fill of them in almost every way. The use of each group is fantastic for me, and I appreciate how just about every character had that purpose and meaning to their inclusion.\n\nThe Comedy: While a bit juvenile at times, the movie's humor is very fun and appropriate for the family. A witty phrase by a guinea pig, the fickle nature of human trends, even just a perfect phrasing that is comedic gold. The Bad Guys uses it all well and mixes things up to stay fresh, exciting, and filled with variety, all while baking it in naturally and not trying to force it in your face. That's right, you don't have to worry about a catchphrase being repeated like crazy, well mostly, and for that, DreamWorks wins the victory for me on the comedy, even if it is not the most mature, clever, or downright unique.\n\n' The Plot: Much like a good book, The Bad Guys wins points again for a book adaptation that felt fleshed out, complete, and again fun. The Bad Guys starts off in the simple aspect you expect it to, high adrenaline comedy crime, and boasting about it afterwards. Soon, the plot starts to dig into deeper into other elements, trying to give more insight into the morals and characters and trying to twist the plot into new directions. And yet... they never drop the foundation of the movie, keeping those involvements and making the story wrap together nicely and feel organic. It's engaging, it's fun, and again it works on multiple levels, with a great performance to again amplify the tale to a quality I like.\n\nIt's Adventure: What do I like highly about this film? It's that it's an adventure film that finally goes back into escaping from the reality of the world, but still teaches a moral lesson. Like the animated films I grew up with, The Bad Guys finally takes me on the adventure and story I like, instead of getting stuck in check boxes and personal issues to make a realistic story. By finally taking a detour back into the world of fun and adventure, the excitement and entertainment stand strong and I had fun watching an animated film. Sure, it's no Oscar tear jerker, but given the style and escape from all the political stuff that's in your face, it excels amazingly in this aspect.\n\nThe Animation: I know, it does not look real, it does not look fully fleshed out, and you probably have other CGI focused movies that do things better. However, the Bad guys has a nice unique modality that stands out from the usual manners of making animation come to life. The kids book style is really popping, and the way they make the group come to life is sensational for this reviewer. The theft scenes are just an opening, and the movie does a great job pushing the limits of this style and really giving you a comic book meets story mode and I loved almost every second of it. In fact, this might be one of the best action scenes I have seen in a long time, proving again with imagination, some guts, and some balance, you can get excitement back in these movies. Nice work on the style and pizazz with your animation my friends, for it succeeded big time for this reviewer.\n\nDISLIKES:\n\nPredictable: I did not even know the movie series was based on books, but I have not read them and was still able to decipher all the twists within the first twenty-five minutes. Sadly, the book is not geared for major surprises, it could have used them to spice things up. At the least, they could have avoided the obvious set up that they did, instead of just giving everything away.\n\nMore Action: With all the things this movie did, I had hoped to see a little more of that factor I really loved. The Bad Guys could have used a few more crime attempts, maybe some plans, or adding a little more of the Ocean's 13 element they were going for. Even some of the less violent oriented moments could have used some more time, but this is relatively minor to the other two elements I wanted in this movie.\n\nMore Time with Some of The Characters: As I said, the cast of characters have their inclusion, but there seemed to be more they could have done with them in the final project. Perhaps this problem is addressed in the books, but several of the other characters needed time to get their own edge and quirks out, other than just being comedic ploys. Shark in particular was funny and has some moments, but there was a lot more potential to work with to make him more than just the comedic punching bag he is. Piranha and Tarantula have a little more ironing out, but again, there is more there, which might be addressed in future installments.\n\nToo Much Revealed in The Trailers: Modern day advertising is both impressive and destructive at the same time. The Bad Guys is one of those moments that gives a lot of the plot away second to the copious number of things they give in the trailer. Though it does not dilute the fun, it did cost me several laughs at the jokes they wanted to hold and in all honesty the surprises they wanted to share. This is probably the biggest thing to take away from the movie for me, but if you avoid the trailers then you are good.\n\nThe VERDICT:\n\nIn this case, being Bad is so Good and I really had a wonderful time with this movie and the endeavors they built for us. With great cast, music and voice acting the movie already had the elements to be a decent film, however making a story with good animation really sent this movie to new heights for me. It's got pizazz, it breaks from the realistic movie moments that are the hot trend, and it does it so in a natural style that again was just fun. It's totally worth the trip to the theater to see, or at least to enjoy when it arrives on streaming in a few weeks. Sure, the movie is predictable, lots of things ruining from the trailers and still has some smoothing out to do. Overall, though, I definitely give this movie a big thumbs up and approve the film for so many.\n\nMy scores are: Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 8.5 Movie Overall 7.5."", ""Upvotes"": ""84"", ""Downvotes"": ""13"", ""Reviewer"": ""rgkarim""}, {""Title"": ""Boring"", ""Rating"": ""1"", ""Review Content"": ""The trailor looked great.

The Machines, Zootropolis and even Captain Underpants too, it's stylistic, it's bright, fast, with so much great attention to detail, along with superb characters designs since the bad guys look so unique and expressive in all the right ways, it has the zany cartoon effects too, the animation really takes advantage of cell shading, but it also makes the characters stand out as being memorable and funny as well, all the characters are fantastic, I loved all of them my favourites would Be Mr. Wolf (Sam Rockwell) Mr. Snake (Marc Maron) Diane (Zazie Beetz) and Professor Marmalade (Richard Ayoade), even the minor characters one are funny as heck, but it's thanks to the cast who brings these characters to live in a unique way!, Sam Rockwell is just charming as Mr. Wolf, Richard Ayoade is always a pleasure hearing his voice in anything, the rest like Anthony Ramos, Awkwafina, Craig Robinson and more are all great and have distinct personalities, heck a lot of them are almost identical to the original source characters, the score by Daniel Pemberton is really outstanding in many ways by how cool and easy on the ears it is, of course he did the score for Spider-Verse so it makes sense to bring him to compose the music for this film, along with a soundtrack that I very much dig, the story maybe the same ol' villain might be hero story like Megamind or Despicable Me, but this at least tries to do it differently and even the conclusion is very satisfying!, so the filmmaking with this story is incredible, this film is the definition of laugh out loud, every moment and joke was funny, even the toilet humour was unique and purposeful to stand out and actually be funny, while also having a nice heart to it, I mean the bad guys are doing good after all, along with a few good twists even the ones you know will eventually come, the action is incredible and so much fun to watch along with creativity also, it's what anyone would want in a film like this!, although with a few changes, it still keeps some elements of the book afloat which is really nice with some nice references too.\n\nGuys what else can I say but this is nothing short of fantastic, the Bad Guys is the best DreamWorks film in a looooong time, it's definitely return to form in terms of well-written DreamWorks films!, it's stylistic, hilarious, new, unique, fun, visually wonderful and captures the spirit of the book rather well while bringing new elements to the world of the Bad Guys that'll make it more and more unique, along with excellent music and a strong cast of characters, I don't have any complaints at all, it's a perfect film for the family to watch, if you are a fan of the studio, see it today since it's early previews in the UK are still going or next week when it officially hits UK cinemas over here very soon, some of the other countries will have a wait a bit longer but it'll be worth it in the end, this is my favourite animated film of the year and one of the best films of the year also!, I'm happy to see a DreamWorks film that isn't in any way mediocre or boring, I loved this film so that I hope to see more of this and not more sequels, also Trolls related media.\n\nI'm happy to give The Bad Guys a 10/10!"", ""Upvotes"": ""47"", ""Downvotes"": ""22"", ""Reviewer"": ""Clank_Zoka""}, {""Title"": ""The Style Was So 😫😍"", ""Rating"": ""8"", ""Review Content"": ""The Animation Style was so good i really love it 2D but it's 3D if im not wrong its called 2.5D, i like The story to, not to fast and not complicated and... i like The plot twist it has a twist and a twist again.

The story is told of Padraic (Farrell), good and kind, who, overnight, loses the consideration of his greatest friend, Colm (Gleeson). Why? Because I don't like you anymore, because you're boring, Colm replies to him, and I don't want to waste my time with you anymore. And Padraic, who is not as sharp and intelligent as he would like to be but is esteemed for his courtesy and good spirits, does not understand this. Colm, who plays the violin and composes music, is obsessed with the passing of time, with the need to indulge his art in order not to be forgotten. His art demands total exclusivity from him, leaving no room for the banality of feelings. But is this the real reason, or is Colm going mad? At this point, what follows is a jeu de massacre between the two ex-friends, surrounded by various minor characters that McDonagh knows how to connote with felicitous psychological notations and a keen sense of humor. And then there are the animals, almost sacred emanations of the island, loved and respected, more than human in their affective reactions. And there is the war, distant but present, of which ominous explosions are heard in the distance.

This film does a great job to put you in the psych of the time and to top that off the cinematography, costumes, music and atmosphere are wonderful.

Welcome to Southampton).\n\nWith regards to the plank of wood.... Sorry... \""Pattison\"". In the initial scenes I was genuinely excited. Never a fan of his costume before, seeing it here - suddenly I \""got it\"". He proper beats down on someone in a vicious attack. They get back up... In fact, everyone he bat-punches gets back up and just attacks him from behind again. There's no real threat here. When Bale smacked someone down, they stayed dead. But then, when Bale stripped off (same as Affleck), they were built. Robert looked like me and I look like Mr. Burns from The Simpsons. A skeletal mess with no beef there whatsoever. In fact, when Robert bent over in one topless scene, his bones stuck out and I thought wings were going to pop out. But then, why wouldn't they when he infamously said he refused to bulk up for the role (I would have sacked him there and then).\n\nHis time as Bruce is strictly limited - thank God - so you can't really judge him for that. As Bruce he just stands there and looks confused. As The Batman, by the end he became a parody. His Batman voice changed to the same sound as the joke Batman in the college humour videos (A is for Alfred = genius). When he was mad, it just look like he was pulling a cum-face. And don't even get me started on the Adrian Mole diary keeping that's going in with the voice-over narration.\n\nHonestly, with the exception of the opening ten minutes or so, I have never hated a film so much as I did this and given I went in with low expectations, even I am surprised at how fuming I am at myself for wasting my time on it."", ""Upvotes"": ""850"", ""Downvotes"": ""690"", ""Reviewer"": ""shawthingproductions""}, {""Title"": ""What are these reviews?

I was looking over my shoulder to see of anyone else was laughing at what cringe this movie delivers.\n\nThe actors in this were one of the highlights excluding the villain (the riddler) and the Batman. Penguin was by far the coolest and best actor. Honestly a good fellas type character. All other supporting actors were also quite good. I however think Robert pattinson a horrible pick for Batman. The whole time he seems like a really awkward and sad goth kid, I was half expecting him to say \""gosh get outta my room\"". Absolutely trash acting The riddler was even worse! He was the major cringe factor in this movie with awful and dorky video calls where he is super non intimidating and laughable. His video calls reminded me of the horror films my 15 year old class mates had made in high school, their budgets were $0.\n\nThe relationship between the Batman and cat woman was my only other plus in this movie. The romance was quite sweet and had a lot of tension. They rode around In their awesome motorcycles just roaring through the town it was really cute.\n\nThe bat mobile was pretty awesome but definitely very weird for a Batman film. The old classic camaro was a little spine chilling not gonna lie.\n\nNow to answer everyone's questions I do think Robert pattinson was a terrible choice for Batman for a few reasons. At first I had no qualms but watching the film made me believe he was a bad and cringey actor for the role, he just isn't a badass over masculine kinda guy, like at all. He seems awkward and it shows. His voice wasn't that great, his body was not very big nor muscular like many other batmans, heck even the joker is ripped in suicide squad. The guy is 6ft exactly but his frame is tiny and it shows next to bigger actors. The story was God awful without spoiling pretty much lots of people die, bombs go off and some personal people Batman knows get injured. Then Batman goes welp I can't be in 3 places at once I'm only human. And proceeds to get ko'd twice throughout the movie and punched lots during fights. He is by far the worst and weakest looking Batman with the worst actor to have played him. The cinematography was good and the horror feeling this brings is good but everything else was just so horrible. Did I mention this film is 3 hours long to have a crap middle and end? Well know I know!. Wow I couldn't wait for thr 3 hours to end and multiple people walked out before the film was half finished.

That force and stabilizing element of the ecological balance are in danger of extinction and the kind of persons who appear in the film is equally destined to disappear... for the sake of \""progress\"".\n\nThe film tells the story of a French couple who live in a town in Galicia, afflicted by the abandonment of its locals and state oblivion. When the French husband convinces a group of Galicians not to sell their land to a Dutch company that wants to install wind turbines, it arouses the hatred of two neighbors in favor of the sale, a hatred that reaches tragic levels.\n\n«As bestas» goes beyond this mere anecdote briefly described and becomes a dramatic treatise that combines elements of ethnography, cultural identity, economy, nationality, migration, gender, xenophobia, crime, and rights to decent work and standard of living. The story follows the Aristotelian structure, although at one point the center of attention shifts from the French man to his wife, who brings the drama to a sensible and reasonable conclusion.\n\n«As bestas» is also graced by the work of the cast, made up of a happy integration of professional and natural actors.

In all honesty, these were the biggest sins of the movie.\n\nThe other problem...it was scaled back for general audiences. The kids are not as mouthy, the double entendres are gone, the innuendo is missing and just the energy is gone. While this sort of thing is built more for the half hour format, there was virtually no sight of this energy in the movie.

(a) The film's opening plays like a 50s family sitcom, complete with the goofy next-door neighbor. (b) A visit from an uncle plays like a horror film. (c) Adolescence is a 'Beach Blanket' movie with Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello, at other times a 'Blackboard Jungle' of bigoted and roughneck bullies. (d) We've got 'OZ's' Yellow Brick Road of a finale, preceded by 'OZ's' Dorothy / Spielberg meeting with the wizard himself and receiving his advice.

The entire first 90 mins was utter boredom of a typical dysfunctional family - all just shallow filler, and the remaining 1 hour was just another high school drama story playing out, with very little substance. What the heck are all these critics raving about... there was nothing brilliant in this dull, bland, self-indulgent shallow slog. I learned more about Spielberg's mom than him. This is literally the most boring Spielberg film I've ever seen, and for that matter, a film no one should care about. Even the screenplay was riddled with unnecessary subplots that had more plot holes than engaging narrative. Granted, the dated set pieces and wardrobe were on point, and all casting and performances spot-on, and the score was perfect. But none of that matters when you're forced to sit through a two and a half hour film that leaves you frustrated and unsatisfied. It's amusing how another great filmmaker, James Cameron, gives us Avatar 2, and Spielberg gives us this nonsense vanity project. You can tell one is falling from grace and the other rising past.

At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.\n\nCouple of comments: this is Steven Spielberg's long-awaited film of his youth. I love and respect Spielberg, but this is Spielberg at his worst: sentimental and self-indulgent. There isn't a single aspect of the movie that I found interesting or redeeming. Why did Spielberg assume that his family's comings and goings, including his parents' marital challenges, would be so unique and hence interesting, when in fact this is what happened to millions and millions of families in the 50s and early 60s. As a complete aside, as most of you know Spielberg lived in Cincinnati until age 11, then moved to Phoenix. A significant early part of the movie plays out in Cincinnati, but there is not a single reference, none, to Cincinnati. Why? In contrast, the second that the family is moving to Phoenix, Arizona, the area is mentioned multiple times in the film. I find it curious, to say the least.\n\n\""The Fabelmans\"" premiered at last Fall's Toronto International Film Festival to immediate critical acclaim and then was released in US theaters just before Thanksgiving. Since then it has significantly underperformed at the box office (a mere $12 million after 7 weeks).

In addition to being a registered nurse, she is both a practicing Reiki Master and a hypnotherapist.",United States,English,6.8,(85K),"[{""Title"": ""An engaging true-crime drama fronted by strong performances by Chastain and Redmayne"", ""Rating"": ""8"", ""Review Content"": ""Set in 2003 at Parkfield Memorial Hospital, Amy Loughren (Jessica Chastain) is a single mother with two daughters working as night nurse in the ICU who suffers from a heart condition but is without Health Insurance and must continue working long hours while keeping it a secret for the next few months before she's qualified for insurance. The hospital is soon joined by nurse Charles \""Charlie\"" Cullen (Eddie Redmayne) who strikes up a friendship with Amy and even helps her during her cardiac episodes at his own expense. However when the death of a patient is put under internal review by Parkfield's risk mitigator, Linda Garran (Kim Dickens), the hospital brings in homicide detectives Danny Baldwin (Nmamdi Asomugha) and Tim Braun (Noah Emmerich), per the directives of the CDC for suspicious hospital deaths but are massively uncooperative only bringing them in 8 weeks after their internal review and with the body already released to the family and cremated. However, when Braun and Baldwin begin examining Charlie's history, they come to believe he may have been involved in the death as does Amy.\n\nThe Good Nurse is an adaptation of the 2013 true crime book, The Good Nurse: A True Story of Medicine, Madness, and Murder by Charles Graeber that details serial killer Charles Cullen. While originally setup at Lionsgate, Lionsgate eventually decided they would no longer be involved and rights to the film were picked up by Netflix. The film is the English language debut for Danish director Tobias Lindholm whose previous credits such as A Hijacking and A War have earned Lindholm considerable acclaim and the latter even scoring Academy Award nominations. With all those elements it's pretty obvious Netflix intends for this to be an awards contender for the Fall movie season and I think this is an undeniably strong prestige piece.\n\nThe Good Nurse features some terrific turns by reliable staples Jessica Chastain and Eddie Redmayne who both feel really at home in their roles. Redmayne is really good as Charlie and while he does capture that coldness you expect during the very few death scenes that are actually on display in the film, the movie looks at Charlie in between those scenes with his genuinely concerned and nurturing attitude he carries towards Amy setting up the tragedy of this situation as the early scenes between him and Chastain almost make you forget for a moment who he is. The movie doesn't frame this situation as a thriller and avoids being exploitative with no lingering on death scenes and sidestepping some of the tropes of lesser serial killer films by framing the story as one of systemic buck passing that allowed Charlie to move from hospital to hospital and no action ever taken to prevent him from continuing for fear it would open these hospitals to lawsuits. The movie's very much an inditement on the nature of the healthcare industry complete with the dramatic irony (that was unfortunately true to life) of Amy being a nurse who can't afford treatment for herself. Jessica Chastain is really good in the role of Amy Loughren and she sells her performance against Redmayne quite effectively. Tobias Lindholm's direction of the film is also quite strong and with its more naturalistic filmmaking style it avoids making itself feel like a TV procedural or thriller by keeping focus on the human element.\n\nThe Good Nurse is a fantastic English language debut for Lindholm and continues the strong work for Chastain and Redmayne.

The ADHD generation needs quick cutting and seizure inducing visuals to keep their attention, and this is the complete opposite.\n\nThe Good Nurse works because of a number of factors. A tight script with a consistent beat, never wavering or faltering, which keeps us going at a slow but deliberate pace through the story. The acting is excellent, with Eddie Raymayne and Jessica Chastain absolutely killing their respective roles.

A film focusing on a single mom who works as a dedicated and caring and overworked ICU nurse, and who is diagnosed with a heart condition requiring a transplant, and who is trying to hang on to her job long enough to secure medical insurance, and who is a loving mom to her two young kids, would normally have enough drama and stress to carry the story. But that's not nearly enough for filmmaker Tobias Lindholm, who has written three outstanding screenplays: THE HUNT (2012), A WAR (2017), and ANOTHER ROUND 2020). Here he's directing a Krysty Wilson-Cairns (LAST NIGHT IN SOHO, 2021) adaptation of Charles Graeber's book about the man who may very well be the most prolific serial killer in history.\n\nJessica Chastain plays nurse Amy Laughren, who is faced with numerous challenges both at work and at home. Despite needing a heart transplant, she keeps this secret from her employer so that she can work the last few months need to gain health insurance through the New Jersey hospital where she works. Strained beyond reasonableness, she sees hope when a new nurse is hired. Charlie Cullen (Eddie Redmayne) discovers her secret and offers to help her - not just with her patient workload, but also with her parenting responsibilities. Charlie is a Godsend for Amy.\n\nToo soon, doubts begin to show. One of Amy's patients dies unexpectedly, and the hospital administrator (Kim Dickens) calls the police, in what is a defensive move to protect the hospital's business rather than uncover the truth. The detectives played by Noah Emmerich and (former NFL star) Nnamdi Asomugha feel handcuffed in their investigation as the hospital blocks their efforts at every turn. Their suspicion focuses on Charlie and his strange work history of being dismissed by 9 previous hospitals.\n\nThe obvious evil here is a medical professional who kills patients, but the enabler of this evil is a hospital system that values reputation and finances over the morally correct decisions. Both are frightening and both are dangerous. Cullen killed at least 29 people, and is suspected of killing upwards of 400. Lindholm sticks to a drab palette to match the grim subject matter, and both Ms. Chastain and Mr. Redmayne take low key approaches to two characters ... one heroic and one truly dangerous.\n\nStreaming on Netflix beginning October 26, 2022."", ""Upvotes"": ""60"", ""Downvotes"": ""35"", ""Reviewer"": ""ferguson-6""}, {""Title"": ""Great Story, Solid Acting"", ""Rating"": ""9"", ""Review Content"": ""Surprisingly captivating film.

And while I often find my own opinion to sway side to side like a pendulum from the critic score to the viewer consensus, in the case of \""The Gray Man,\"" I am planted firmly with the audience. Admittedly, the critics, pretentious as they seem to be, may or may not have some valid complaints; the film can be said to have a lack of innovation and ingenuity with its storytelling, and in terms of its purported \""bland\"" visuals, the movie is rather dark, which caused me to squint and strain my eyes in the theatre. Besides those two things, however, \""The Gray Man\"" is a super solid action film that constantly pumps adrenaline into the veins of its viewers.\n\nWith the breathtaking, neon drenched opening sequence, you will immediately recognize that there is competency behind, and in front of, the camera. Ryan Gosling and the gorgeous Ana de Armas are thrust front and center in the introduction, and their stoic, serious performances also demonstrate a dedication to quality - this isn't your typical Netflix production that's meant to only be viewed on your laptop monitor. A masterclass in tension building, the opening action sequence alone will tell you all you need to know about \""The Gay Man\"" - it delivers. Expertly helmed with smooth transitions from hiding in plain sight stealth to John Wick style shootouts and Bourne-esque hand-to-hand combat sequences, the first fifteen to twenty minutes of the movie contains some of the most exciting and impressive looking scenes of action that I've seen in a film, period. From Gosling silently taking out enemies in the midst of New Years fireworks to engaging in a fist fight in the middle of said fireworks display, my jaw was planted on the ground as soon as this movie started. And the intensity didn't stop there.\n\nA fight on a military aircraft that ends in a desperate dive back down to solid ground? Check. A city market shootout that turns into a city-wide car chase? Check. A sneaky house invasion that goes from quiet to guns blazing at the drop of a hat? Check. With \""The Gray Man,\"" the Russo brothers put their talent of action on full display by making literally every single action sequence seem like it should be taking place at the climax of the film. After every set piece I found myself thinking, \""Surely things can't get any bigger from here,\"" and the next set piece always upped the ante and blew my expectations out of the water. The minimal use of shaky camera and hyperactive editing will also ensure a clear line of sight with most - if not all - of the action, empowering viewers to feel absolutely immersed in what's occurring on screen.\n\nRyan Gosling is as handsome, muscular, and attractive as ever in his role as Six, a man who has a particular set of skills that you probably don't want to be on the receiving end of. Foregoing the quiet hero performance that so many other movies wanted him to emulate, \""The Gray Man\"" allows Gosling to be charismatic, a suave talker who is as smooth with his words as he is with his proclivity toward violence. Chris Evans also got jacked for his performance as Lloyd Hansen, a merciless killer who actively enjoys inflicting pain on others. The film pits Six and Lloyd against each other in a Evans v Gosling match up that I never even knew I wanted. Evans looks like he is having an absolute blast in his role, seemingly more comfortable playing a villain than he was as a superhero. And as a Gosling fan I may be a bit biased, but I of course thought he was great in the movie; there is no Oscar-worthy acting at play here, but it's clear that everyone is playing their part professionally.\n\n\""The Gray Man\"" is a movie that is being lambasted by critics - that's the only sign you need that it's actually going to be good. This is a very thrilling action film that I am legitimately looking forward to watching again when it releases on Netflix. If you're a fan of action movies, you cannot go wrong here. Sure, the film may have benefited by being a little bit brighter visually, and there were a few moments of iffy editing, but none of the cons overpower the astounding action pros."", ""Upvotes"": ""278"", ""Downvotes"": ""275"", ""Reviewer"": ""darkreignn""}, {""Title"": ""Nothing new"", ""Rating"": ""4"", ""Review Content"": ""The problem with action movie reviews is that people tend to overestimate insignificant movies like that while labeling them as 'good fun' and that drags entire genre to the bottom like an outlier in a non-weighted average.

I expect him and Russel Crowe to see nominations next award season for their work here, but while Crowe is chewing every scene he is in, Efron gives a much more subtle performance.

It is wildly ambitious triptych, which uses stop motion animation to explore peculiar inhabitants in a house through different periods of time and worlds. All the stories take place at the same house, across different eras exploring the theme of home, capitalism, existential crisis, dreams and emptiness as the living are reduced to inanimate entities.\n\nIn Emma de Swaef & Marc James Roels opening act, \""And Heard Within. A Lie Is Spun,\"" it is a gothic tale with all the classic haunted house genre troupes. We follow the Raymond family who abandon their modest lifestyle and relocate to a luxurious mansion nearby, it belongs to Van Schoonbeek, a mysterious and faceless architect. What follows is the supernatural drama which is developed in a very interesting labyrinth like narrative. There are so many moments but everything is presented with an indispensable horror subtext. Even the furniture and the mundanity of Raymond family does accentuate the atmosphere of the film. It is normal but disturbing with eerie soundtrack by Gustavo Santaolalla. My pick and my favourite in this three-part anthological film.\n\nThe second chapter, directed by Niki Lindroth von Bahr's is titled \""Then Lost is Truth that Can't be Won,\"" set in the modern world, at the centre of the story is an anthropomorphic rat. He is now the developer for the Van Schoonbeek's estate and desperately hopes for a good buyer. He is disillusioned with the way his life unfolds and is bombarded with calls from the bank. He is enthusiastic about the unannounced visit of a couple who show interest to buy the house but later finds out their motive. This leads to all sorts of miscommunication and strife with the strange visitors. From there, a Kafkaesque labyrinth is built based on the home invasion genre and it is impossible for the protagonist to recover. The existential crisis increases with the passing of days, it turns out the person (darling) who he speaks over phone is his dentist. He is plagued by bugs and in the midst of all the stuff, there is Busby Berkeley-esque dance number for the vermin. It is funny and sad but never taking itself too seriously but reveals the obsession which cost the protagonist everything. In order to not give away everything, i don't want to reveal much.\n\nThe concluding chapter, directed by Paloma Baeza \""Listen Again and Seek The Sun\"" is set in a post-apocalyptic flooded wasteland and the setting serves as the backdrop for the Van Schoonbeek estate. A fed-up landlady (Rosa) has to put up with the antics of her laid back tenants - Jen and Elias who never pay their rent in money but through crystal stone and fish. Jen is visited by her partner Cosmos and this irks Rosa. Nevertheless, she agrees to offer accommodation in return to restore the dilapidated house. This decision turns the life of the landlady completely upside down resulting in a bittersweet ending. This chapter is a hodgepodge and doesn't seem to fit with the tone of the previous two. It also blends humour and emotion well with little room for surrealism.\n\nMinor quibbles aside, i'm happy that Netflix backed this experiment. I was surprised when a niche series like Brand New Cherry Flavor was sold to the mainstream. I was so impressed with The Summit of the Gods (2021) and The Mitchells vs. The Machines (2021). I hope they can assemble many more such experiments and balance it with a commercially clickbait titles too.\n\nOverall, If you are into stop-motion animation, this is a must watch. Those who can appreciate surrealism from a purely visual point of view, i bet you won't be disappointed by this film. If you happen to love this, i recommend a list of underrated filmmakers who have some amazing stop motion titles to their credit: Lee Hardcastle, Robert Morgan, Christiane Cegavske, Jirí Barta, Regina Pessoa, Suzan Pitt, Tadanari Okamoto, Tomoki Misato, Izabela Plucinska, Siqi Song, Daria Kashcheeva, Jan Balej, Dave Borthwick, Martha Colburn, Phil Tippett, Cesar Cabral, Katariina Lillqvist, Takeshi Yashiro, Jirí Trnka, Brothers Quay, Len Lye, Anna Solanas, Bruce Bickford, Marc Riba, Jan Lenica, Keita Kurosaka, Ujicha, Joaquín Cocina and Cristobal Leon worth checking out in that regards."", ""Upvotes"": ""82"", ""Downvotes"": ""18"", ""Reviewer"": ""samxxxul""}, {""Title"": ""A collection of bricks."", ""Rating"": ""7"", ""Review Content"": ""Though 'IMDb' lists 'The House (2022)' as a TV series*, 'Netflix' presents it as a feature-length affair and plenty of online sources (including 'Wikipedia' and several reputable film critics) refer to it as a movie. As such, I'm going to consider it a feature film, making it the first film I've seen that was initially released in 2022. It's also worth noting that, although its three stories exist more or less in isolation from one another, the thing feels like a cohesive experience that presents a few different interpretations of its central concept (so it's better suited to a movie than a mini-series, in my opinion). The first flick of the year is usually a bit subpar, but this is far from such. It's actually pretty great. The piece is an anthology of stop-motion animation that tells three distinct stories, each of which surround the eponymous house regardless of the fact that they're separated by many years and, even, the species of creature they focus on. The fact that the three stories star humans, rats and cats respectively can be interpreted in a few ways. Firstly, the changes in species could be entirely stylistic, meaning that the characters are represented by humans, rats and cats but are actually always one of the three (perhaps whichever you most connect with). Secondly, the timeline could be entirely linear and be set over a couple of thousand years rather than a couple of hundred, with giant rats at some point overthrowing humans before then themselves being overthrown by giant cats. The third possibility is that the house transcends conventional boundaries of space and time, occupying several different realities (across which these three stories take place). This aspect of the picture isn't particularly important and is certainly open to interpretation, like most of the narrative's surrealist events. It isn't so much a straightforward plot as it is a sort of unsettling mood poem. Even though the three stories are written by the same person, they feel wildly different in terms of tone and theme. Even their aesthetics are unique, the loose wool of the first segment contrasting sharply with the crisp fibres of the last. The segments compliment each other, though. In a way, they each start with the same concept and take it in their own direction, which makes for a consistently compelling watch. The first segment is, for me, the highlight, with a genuinely creepy atmosphere and a wonderfully moody aesthetic. There's something almost intangible about it and it often makes you smile because of how confidently bizarre it is. It feels like 19th century gothic horror, even if it's a lot more surreal than most entries in that genre, and it's certainly the most conventionally disquieting short in the film. The second segment has a surprisingly effective final moment, though, which is all the more startling because most of this story plays out like a pseudo 'kitchen sink' drama about an uncannily realistic renovator. As a result, it's actually rather scary as a whole. Its down-to-earth central performance and its nuanced animations make it feel remarkably true to life despite the fact that it features talking rodents. This is actually one of the things that makes it get under your skin, since it feels so strangely familiar and stressfully alien all at once. The moments of genuine comedy (largely absent from the first story) also add to this effect. The picture's third segment is very light on horror, more or less whittling its scares down to the gnawing realisation that the protagonist has been trapped by her own domesticity. It's a different sort of horror and it plays out more like a drama for most of its duration. Its hopeful ending is also tinged with a dash of sadness; perhaps it's too good to be true? Despite not being creepy, the final movement is still effective and engaging. Overall, this is a really solid animated horror film. Its aesthetic is gorgeous and its concepts are oddly engrossing. It isn't terrifying, but it is unsettling and it has the ability to provoke real retrospection. It's an entertaining affair from start to finish. 7/10.\n\n*'IMDb' has subsequently altered the movie's page, which means that 'The House (2022)' is now correctly labelled as a film rather than a TV show."", ""Upvotes"": ""79"", ""Downvotes"": ""20"", ""Reviewer"": ""Pjtaylor-96-138044""}, {""Title"": ""Animation is top-notch;the problem is the story"", ""Rating"": ""6"", ""Review Content"": ""Animation is superlative.

If you have seen the trailer for this movie then you've pretty much seen the entire movie, including the big twist reveal, which sucks as the story has so much potential. In the right capable hands, a story of someone trying to find their long-lost family and then ending up in a horror situation can be pretty good but here, it falls flat. The story takes forever to get going and once it does start to pick up the pace the movie was almost over. I know that horror movies need time to set up the setting and dynamics but this movie just did WAY too much of that. I've heard a lot of people say this and honestly, I agree with them that this story would be better as a RomCom. The two leads, more on them later, have chemistry between the two of them that just gets wasted because of the story of this movie. If it had been a RomCom movie it might've been one I actually enjoyed as it would've been a unique movie. I quickly touched on this earlier but my biggest issue with this movie wasn't the story for this movie, I already figured the trailer spoiled the whole movie, but the pacing of the movie. This movie is a horror thriller movie and the pacing for this movie didn't match that one bit. It had slower pacing to it which can be effective in the right kind of horror movie but definitely not here. I guess the slow pacing of this movie was supposed to help keep the suspense of wondering what's really happening in the manor but like I said the trailer already ruined that mystery so it wasn't effective. Also due to the slow pacing of the movie the ending for this movie gets severely rushed.\n\nThe ending for this movie just isn't satisfactory and just leaves the audience scratching their heads wondering what just happened. The ending also leaves on kind of a cliffhanger that doesn't need to be a cliffhanger and I wish it had ended earlier. While watching this movie I was preparing myself to say other than the acting in this movie the cinematography for this movie was great and then the more I thought about it the less I enjoyed it. The part I enjoyed of the cinematography was the set design for the manor. The manor itself was gorgeous and had this unease about it right from the get-go. I feel like I would rewatch this movie just to try and pick up the subtle details in the design work for this manor as I feel like I missed a bunch. Another element that works but only to a certain extent is the lighting for this movie. The lighting for this movie creates a great atmosphere and adds to the gothic nature of the manor but it also has a downside as I said that's because this is a horror movie and horror movies are supposed to have scares in them and due to the darkened lighting it's hard to see them. You can kind of tell based on the shadows if something scary is going to happen but for the most part, you can't see them and it just seems like something in the background. Now, these kinds of scares can work but they need to be directed properly and unfortunately for this movie that didn't happen. Now, I know that Jessica M. Thompson did her best with this movie especially with this being her first feature film but unfortunately there were some questionable directing choices. As I said most of them just surround the scares in this movie but also with death scenes in this movie. I won't fully go into detail about the death scenes for this movie but all I'll say is they don't match the 14A rating at all. I already mentioned this but really the only fully good element of this movie is the acting in it. The acting for this movie both worked for whichever story you decide to watch this movie as. If you decide to watch this story like it's a Vampire romance or a horror movie it is the acting works for both versions.\n\nThis fully steams to the main two actors Nathalie Emmanuel and Thomas Doherty, who plays Walter. The two of them surprisingly had decent chemistry together and made this movie slightly enjoyable. I really enjoyed Nathalie Emmanuel's performance as Evie that even without the romance element she would've stood out the most. She plays Evie in such a modern final girl way and even though she might not be the best final girl out there she still proved how smart she is even with the story does have her making some dumb decisions. But for me personally, the standout performance of the movie is Thomas Doherty. He plays Walter in such a manipulative and conniving way that if you were in this situation you would trust him. When you first meet Walter you can easily tell there's something off about him and if you didn't watch the trailer you're wondering what's fully up with him. Even the side actors were really good in this movie even if you don't get to see them as much. In the end, The Invitation had the potential to be a really good movie but because of the trailer it just falls short. If you go see this movie just play the fun game of switching the genre depending on what's happening in the scene."", ""Upvotes"": ""128"", ""Downvotes"": ""29"", ""Reviewer"": ""Benslie""}, {""Title"": ""So bad that it's cringeworthy - they're still making movies this mediocre?"", ""Rating"": ""3"", ""Review Content"": ""\""The Invitation\"" sucks! Any review that you read with a score higher than a 5 out of 10 is a straight up lie - and I don't say that lightly; no man, woman, or child can watch this movie and legitimately think that it's good. From the opening scene, you can inherently tell that this movie will be the pinnacle of mediocre, and at least from that perspective it doesn't disappoint!\n\nA self-proclaimed vampire film (this isn't a spoiler, as the trailer literally gave away the entire plot of this film), \""The Invitation's\"" first sin is being PG-13. Sure, there are some moments here and there that push the boundaries with little spurts of blood and quickly edited around gore, but other than that - for a vampire movie - this was weirdly bloodless. But I get it! The studio wants to get as many butts in seats as possible; how about making a quality movie first? An R rating doesn't matter as long as the movie is good, but \""The Invitation\"" is not.\n\nGod, I don't even know where to start with this, because literally every aspect of this movie was bad. The dialogue! Oh sweet Lord, the dialogue - I wanted to stick needles in my ears to stop myself from hearing the utterly cringeworthy lines that came out of everyone's mouth. The acting? It was fine; everyone was a good actor, it's just that the script dragged them down into the very depths of hell. The action? Ha! What action?\n\nThis movie is an hour and 44 minutes long, and an hour and 10 minutes is spent dragging the plot out through the dirt. I'm not even kidding - I checked my watch; the horror shenanigans start when there is only 30 minutes left in the movie. By that point, the movie is practically over and every viewer is checked out due to the previous hour and 10 minutes of soap opera crap. But fine, if the final 30 minutes was good, then all would be forgiven - but it's not good. The final 30 minutes are not only all spoiled in the trailer but also aren't fun to watch even when expanded upon. Awful CGI, terrible editing, and poorly filmed fight sequences are all you'll be privy to - add the PG-13 rating, and you get nary a blood spurt to enjoy.\n\nAnd speaking of editing, sweet Jesus, it's so bad. Every scene is edited in a tactical, almost methodical way - one that is reserved for direct to TV garbage. There is no skill at play here; it's almost like the entire crew read a \""Filmmaking for Dummies\"" book, and took every line to heart in every single aspect of the filmmaking process. Nothing is innovative, nothing is creative, and nothing is entertaining.\n\nThe only reason I'm giving this three stars out of 10 is because it didn't bore me - my utter disbelief at how poor this movie was kept me engaged until the end. I didn't despise this movie, but I'm shocked that the studio allowed something of this caliber to be released in theatres. Do I regret my decision to see this?

The Invitation has a lot of things to decipher in the short run time, but it's always moving and seldom slowing down to get bogged in higher order thinking. For those looking for just a way to turn off the mind, this can be a giant plus alongside the appeal of one component of the story.\n\nThe Setting: It's a beautiful world they have shot/created, in this movie. A European centered mansion and castle that is sort of the dark version of Downton Abbey. The rooms they play in are immaculate, both high society, but several holding darker undertones that tell a story almost better than the actual words and story itself. I highly enjoyed the realistic manor and sort of felt like a board game or mystery room feel that could have been used so well.\n\nThe Potential Story: The story is not the worst I've seen, and holds some elements of an engaging character. This film is a neo-gothic style drama with elements of horror and romance sprinkled in to try and live up to the stories of the classic horror films. Paying homage to the tales it references were nice, and there was a lot of quality points they could have used to help guide this to be one of the better tales. Throw in some darker comedy like Ready or Not, and the overall feel of the movie showed there was potential.\n\nThe Lighting Effects: A small and subtle nod to the elements, the lighting really tells much of the story and brings much of the emotion in this film. From the opening scene, every moment has an area of lighting that sets the tone of the moment and suggest the element of the scene. Foreboding dark rooms make the moment obvious, but other elements that blend dark and light each offer a level of safety to dive into.\n\nThe Costumes: Now my second favorite component, the costumes and makeup of the movie are fantastic for me given what I guess was \""lower\"" budget production. The Invitation may not be dressing up the groups in superhero underwear, or the most amazing warrior costumes, but the costumes chosen really do blend the modern and traditional well. Fantastic dresses are my favorite, the material holding a lot of design qualities that tell their own story while also really accomplishing the attitudes of the characters who wear them. Male characters often have the shirts found in many English tales, part class and debonair mixed with something more as the story progresses. Throw in the more \""romantic\"" moments and the modern blend comes in to help reestablish the timelines. And when makeup is needed for the various events that occurred, once more the effects of mimicking blood, paleness, and injuries continuing to be realistic and incredible.\n\nThe Effects: I can't say much about this without giving away an obvious point. The Invitation has moments that really require certain computer animation effects, editing, and prosthetics to help accomplish the tasks at hand. I loved it, and the sneaking subtle moments give you a taste of the big moments at the end of the movie to come. That blend of using prosthetics and the computer met the balance so many movies fail to achieve and I only wish we had more time with it.\n\nDISLIKES:\n\nPredictable: I got it from the trailer even though the clips did not reveal what the twist was. The movie should not be too hard to decipher what will happen as the dialogue plays out. The clues are handed a little too easily, the hints too obvious and of course the subtle things sneaking out a bit to reveal the big twist. Had the other elements not taken a hit because of this, or there had been more story element, this would not have been an issue, but something was just askew that led to predictability being too much.\n\nNot Scary/Suspenseful: They dock it up it as a horror film of the century, but it lacked scares for me in this film despite their best attempts. Much of this has to do with how desensitized I am to the trailer, but the elements don't quite mix well for me to execute the full effect of the horror to be really scary. It lacks a creepy atmosphere, the intensity of the horror is blunted by quick finishes, and the direction eventually takes it to neo-gothic style drama over anything else. Thus, with such changes in style and several other factors, the movie's horror element is dull.\n\nRushed Story: That pace might be good for getting in and out of the theater, and also trying to get to all the parts they want to talk about. However, the story that held a lot of potential also got sideswiped a bit in the process, resulting in of course missing pieces. The Invitation has so many components that a book form would do well to elaborate, build, and expand upon that a movie seemed to have suffered with time limits. The main character Evie, has a lot of potential for uncovering her past, facing her hardships, and fostering bonds, but it's all lost to the fleeting time. Then the mystery of the manor and trying to figure out the truth was robbed even more of the quality, each act feeling like a set up to something big and then just fizzling out. Again so much potential, but lost.\n\nForced Performances: I can't deny this, the acting does at times get too force and lose the presentation that they were doing. Primarily at the end, many actors have to transition into a different kind of acting, one that either did not get rehearsed as well as they could, or was just planned to be this extravagant in the forced gestures, acting, and screaming that comes. It lost the class I was seeing, and the whole conclusion seemed very dropped in a mad rush to get to the end. Some people suffered through the movie itself, Corneliussen playing her arrogance a might too strong, but it's that ending where the cheese factor oozes out.\n\nAn Attempt At Action: I said earlier that the movie tries to incorporate a lot of genre elements into the mix. Well, the ending makes a break for trying add a little excitement by converting it into an action film moment to bring about the full end. The fight is, well it's mediocre at best for me, fitting with the setting, but give the buildup did little to match what other movies of this genre could do. The choreography was extremely limited, the acting forced and awkward, and the time with it was again very limited, meaning it felt like the action in a Soap Opera with slaps and screams, than actual merit. And when the story elements drag in and the dialogue creeps in, this moment just fails outside of a some sweet finishes to heighten the drama component. It wasn't needed to this caliber, and I would have liked to see more strategy or rehearsal come in for it to be included.\n\nThe Lack Of Focused Direction: My buddy said it best, the heart of The Invitation's problems arises in the lack of focused direction for the film and trying to do too much in such a short time. All these elements do give nods to the tropes of the horror theme they were going for, but none of them fully deliver to tie them all well. This comes with time, focus, and in all honesty a mini-series or book to flesh it all out in the proper details and tie ins. Because of that, all the moments are okay and will fill the time with something, but the promise again was sullied by too much at once and becoming more a mess that is just okay.\n\nThe VERDICT: The Invitation shows how ideas have an immense promise and the modern edge of retelling and combination could work if planned out right. There are so many homages and snippets of scenes that work and had me intrigued, but then get ripped away to mediocre finishes and hasty tie ups. What results is an average movie that is more neo-gothic drama with some thriller twists, that should be good for a teenager based audience. Note, there are some moments that might be harder for people to see in the form of boundary violation, torture, confinement, and some rather occult appetites that sensitive people will the. Past that though, the chill and scare factor are minimal and in all honesty quite boring to watch given what the trailers promised. Predictable plots, messy editing, rushed story elements, and other hasty decisions just robbed the full splendor this movie could have been. I can't say this one is a theater visit outside the aesthetics, and would rather watch it at home instead.

I love how it starts off dark, it's not uncommon for recent horrors to ease you in by starting out like any regular movie before throwing you into the dark. It maintains it's gloomy nature despite the characters having a more cheery aura, but you feel something's off. It's like a blend of midsommer, Ready or Not and Get Out, with a fantasy element to it. Midsommer and Ready Or Not were more bloody thrillers than actual horrors in my opinion while this was actively trying to scare you. It has a more old fashioned horror feel compared to recent 'blockbuster horrors' (I don't know if that's a thing); everything happens in the dark, there's a lot of build up and I loved how 3AM was made the hour the devil comes out to play. It also leaned on it's gloomy atmosphere and jump scares for the horror element.\n\nThere's a lot of build up to most scenes so it was slow paced, I felt some silences were literally just 2s too long. Second twist in the third act of the movie wasn't pretty underwhelming, and this was meant to be the big closer.

Furthermore, the dialogue, humor, and plot devices are subpar. The cast enhances the material (especially Pitt and Radcliffe), but some scenes are groaners. Tatum's charisma shines through and Pitt's cameo provides flavor, but that isn't enough to pull The Lost City out of mediocrity. It isn't painful, but The Lost City misses more than it hits.\n\nMeanwhile, The Lost City's filmmaking is average. Its minor positives are the cinematography (intermittently dramatizing comedy and action), the sound (selling the combat and jungle setting), the production design (primarily real but often computerized), and the effects (employing real explosions amongst the CGI). Conversely, the editing occasionally sags (lingering on unessential jokes) and the music is distractingly trendy (forcing fun, rather than serving the narrative).

I remember a time when there was possibly a big comedy coming out every one or two months, with at least half of them being good, but in today's climate, humour is just tough to get right. I was very happy to see that Paramount would be taking a chance and releasing a big comedy in The Lost City this year, but I truly didn't know to what to expect from it. After seeing it in theatres, I'm happy to say that I had a good time with it. It's not great, but it felt like a throwback comedy, just with a modern twist.\n\nTo put it simply, The Lost City follows Loretta (Sandra Bullock) as she's on a book tour with her cover model Alan (Channing Tatum) to promote the release of \""The Lost City of D,\"" but they are swept up in a kidnapping and find themselves on a real adventure in the jungle. Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe) is the reason Loretta was kidnapped in the first place, as he sees many similarities in her book to that of a real lost city. Being the privileged twerp that he is makes for a fun villainous storyline, even if it's pretty lame at times. Radcliffe aside (whom I still enjoyed), this film puts all of its weight on Tatum and Bullock to deliver the goods.\n\nThis premise is clever enough to work as a film, but it all comes down to who you cast and if they can make the material work. I never thought I needed to see this duo together, but I'm very happy they worked so well. On top of that, I have to admit that the best moments in the film feature Brad Pitt's character Jack Trainer. He isn't in the film much, but every second he was on screen had me laughing. Where I found the film to be slightly uneven though, was in the fact that I wasn't sure if it wanted to be funny or dramatic at times.\n\nI'm all for heartfelt storylines as well as comedy, but I would argue that the majority of the humour is in the first half, while the second half gets a little more sentimental. These both worked in the movie, but the way the film begins gives absolutely no foreshadowing as to what the film will become by the end. I found that odd, but again, the cast sold all of the dialogue for me. From a few hilarious moments to some fun adventure/action throughout, as I said, I had a good time with this one.\n\nIn the end, The Lost City is exactly what I think moviegoers need right now. Nothing too serious or weighed down by heavy drama. This is a good old-fashioned, silly comedy/romance that I feel works for what it is. It's not going to be the type of comedy that a lot of people are going to watch over and over again, at least I don't think, but the heart of the film is in the right place and it never takes anything too seriously.

And this is exactly why I loved it, it's the kind of film that I really miss seeing a lot of; they type that typically gets dumped on streaming these days. It's an old-fashioned crime thriller that takes place in one location and is a dialogue driven story... and believe it or not it's not part of a franchise! It's a very well done film and is certainly going to be one of the most underrated films of 2022. If you're reading this, don't sleep on it, go see it right away! I didn't even watch a trailer for it, I went in pretty much blind, and absolutely loved it! I ate it right up; it was a huge, pleasant surprise! It's a perfect classic day-in-the-life of a mobster tale!\n\nWriter-director Graham Moore really brings a Hitchcock frame of mind to this film. It takes place all in one location, has a small cast and yet could not be more intense and impressive! The script is immaculate, one of the best crime thriller scripts I've seen in ages and feels like it actually has a high quality feel to it. There are so many awesome twists and turns throughout, and some truly electric dialogue. I also loved how it uses the concept of Chekhov's gun to cleverly setup and subvert expectations, it made the twists even more satisfying! Every time I thought I had the film figured out, it turned the tables on me, keeping me in suspense. Moore handles the suspense so well, in very Hitchcockian ways and the movie is constantly gripping, interesting and intense! However while the films abundance and reliance on its twists is its greatest strength, it's also its greatest flaw as it slightly pushed my suspension of disbelief a little far and messed with the pacing at times. But the pros far outweigh the cons. I also loved how cleverly Moore made use of the space (the tailor shop), which was immaculately and thoroughly utilized throughout. I was constantly surprised how they kept finding new ways to use the space and evolve the story! The only downside was that this didn't allow for the cinematography to be as impressive or eye popping as it could have been; it was good but not overly creative, just purely functional.\n\nAnother huge strength of the film is it's impressive cast and stellar performances! Mark Rylance kills it in this movie, he delivers such a daring and phenomenal performance as Leonard. It's incredibly nuanced and I just love how he slowly revealed more about his character through ways he behaved and slight tendencies in dialogue delivery. The story also really helped here, I loved how it slowly pulled back the curtain on the character as the film went on, and you couldn't help but root for him. Zoey Deutch was also such a surprise, she was so good in this, and Dylan O'Brien and Johnny Flynn were also great and need to be in more stuff! All the acting in the film was incredible, it blew me away. The actors alongside the great script truly carry the film and are the reason I loved it as much as I did!\n\nThe Outfit isn't flashy, but it's a very solid story with a tightly tailored performance from Mark Rylance.

His path from London to the windy city is a bit murky, but we immediately take note of Leonard's calm and elegant presence accompanied by his soothing voice. Rylance uses that voice as narrator to explain the intricacies involved with creating a man's suit, and the importance of reading the man prior to utilizing the 4 fabrics and 38 pieces that make-up the outfit. Leonard is also protective of Mable (Zoey Deutch, ZOMBIELAND: DOUBLE TAP, 2019), his assistant who dreams of traveling the globe.\n\nAn early montage shows us how the mob utilizes Leonard's shop for drops, and trusts him due to his 'see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil' demeanor. Leonard is one cool dude, and it's obvious we (and the mob) are underestimating him ... but we can't quite figure out why or by how much. One crazy night changes everything. Richie (Dylan O'Brien, THE MAZE RUNNER franchise) is brought into the tailor shop after being shot by a rival gang ambush. He's accompanied by Francis (Johnny Flynn, EMMA., 2020), and the dynamics between these two is quite interesting. Richie is the son of the Boyle family patriarch and has been seeing Mable on the side, while Francis is the favored employee after saving Roy Boyle (Simon Russell Beale) by taking gun fire. Richie is a whiny, spoiled wannabe tough guy, while Francis is volatile and constantly sneering.\n\nWhat follows is a bit Hitchcockian. We have plot twists, murder, backstabbing, danger, and surprises. When it's discovered the Boyle family has a rat that is feeding details to the rival cross-town gang and the FBI, things get tense thanks partially to a MacGuffin audio tape. It all leads to confrontations in the shop, and some nice scene-chewing from Simon Russell Beale and Nikki Amuka-Bird as the leader of the rival gang. An elaborate plan by one of the characters is a pleasant surprise (to us, not the others). As Leonard points out on a couple of occasions, he's a \""cutter\"", not a tailor - a distinction he takes as seriously as his skill with shears. The film's title has double meaning: the suits Leonard crafts, and the national syndicate that involves the Boyle family. Most of this we've seen before, but it's Rylance's portrayal of Leonard that offers a different look and feel.

Writer-director Grahame Moore brings a Hitchcock frame of mind with one dominant location, an atelier holding no more than four or five characters, just like a theater stage, and a sense of foreboding coming from history and the characters themselves, just like the modern psychological thrillers do.\n\nJust watch out for those scissors-Hitch would love the touch.\n\nUnderneath the simple set is a rumbling of sin as the meek tailor, Leonard, contends with three mobs threatening him and his secretary, Mable (Zoey Deutch). He is required to stitch around those who want to kill each other and destroy his business, with different crooks coming in the front door intent on finding a tape that allegedly would send them to jail.\n\nThe joy of this neo-noir thriller is the suspense that Hitchcock virtually patented because his non-mob characters are seemingly innocent types, and his sinners not quite in control of their ambitions. What Hitch and other thriller directors like Moore want is to show the vulnerability of the common citizen and the weaknesses of the seasoned mobsters.\n\nAlthough it's up to Leonard, small haberdashery owner in Chicago, to protect his shop, he also, in a narcotic-like voice over, explains the allegorical implications of his cutting and sewing. For instance, he is not a tailor but rather a cutter. The former artless, the latter a professional trained for years on London's iconic Saville Row.\n\nNo recent film has surpassed The Outfit's ability to reveal the wickedness of humanity and its adaptability while supplying a dose of old-time noir. Delight in the spare set, the super acting, and the innumerable closeups that do as much to reveal character as the uncomplicated, Pinter-like dialogue.\n\nAlthough this tidy feature, similar to Leonard in its meticulous revelation of character and motive, seems suited to streaming, it is a euphoric experience on the big screen as the spare audiences can be enveloped by the powerful characters and story, in a setting that puts all in a dynamic room with mystery aplenty."", ""Upvotes"": ""179"", ""Downvotes"": ""36"", ""Reviewer"": ""JohnDeSando""}, {""Title"": ""Fitting plan"", ""Rating"": ""9"", ""Review Content"": ""Suspend your disbelief - it is possible to do so.

While I haven't read the novel the film is based on, I strongly suspect that despite its nifty premise -- \""Hey, let's set a murder mystery at West Point when Poe was a cadet there!\"" -- it is probably, in execution, as plodding as this film.\n\nDisappointingly, you actually get to see very little of the military academy; instead, most of the action takes place in taverns and cabins and fancy dining rooms, or in the snowy woods. Despite the lengthy run time, we never get a good sense of the geography. West Point itself looks ridiculously understaffed, as if the entire institution is run by the same three British actors! All of them strut around looking sinister and secretive and bad-tempered for no apparent reason, except, I guess, a need to make the proceedings seem more interesting.\n\nThe good news is that Christian Bale makes an appealing 19th-century detective -- he wears an air of authority and seems genuinely sympathetic and intelligent -- and Harry Melling makes a dramatic, vividly romantic young Poe.

It's predictable and no gritty plot twists which might be a downside for some but I wasn't expecting that to begin with.

When I saw that the running time was 148 minutes, I was even more skeptical. Would I be able to sit through it? But I got curious and just started the movie, even though I actually wanted to go to bed. Well, what can I say? I easily made it to the end and in the end I didn't even think the movie was that long. Just now, as I was writing these lines here, I read the fresh review from my favorite movie site and was horrified.... by myself. Can it be that I like such a cheesy movie with partly bad effects? Am I abnormal? Even the ratings on IMDB say it's a bad movie. Well, I see it a bit different. But let's start from the beginning.\n\nYes, \""The School for Good and Evil\"" is tremendously cheesy and full of clichés. Yes, the film is perhaps a touch too unserious. Yes, the film steals mercilessly from well-known films of the genre, especially a lot from Harry Potter. Yes, the supporting characters are superficial and sometimes annoying. Yes, the effects are sometimes bad and cheap. And yet ... I really like the movie. Now I'm sure everyone thinks I'm crazy. First I write how bad everything is and then I say that I like it. But ... why? The answer is short, concise and banal: Emotions and feelings!\n\nYes, I shouldn't really like the film because of the bad aspects. But who knows me, knows: Emotions and feelings are in films and series for me sometimes the most important. Yes, but where do these emotions come from? Are they hiding between all the kitsch, the stolen and the superficial and the bad effects? The answer is: No. They are not hiding at all. The emotions come straight from the center of the film: the two main actresses and their characters.\n\nSofia Wylie embodies Agatha, a brash but also deeply human and sympathetic teenage girl. She brings across Agatha's feelings and emotions in such a wonderful way that Agatha immediately grows on me. Cliché or not, I like her a lot and it carries me through half the film.\n\nThe same goes for Sophia Anne Caruso, who embodies Sophie. She is a sweet and kind girl who has the courage to stand up for her best friend Agatha and defend her. The friendship between Agatha and Sophie is strong and convincing. Sophie, however, wants to get away from the place where they live. She doesn't feel comfortable there, where everyone else despises her and Agatha and has only scorn and ridicule for them. So she is drawn into the magical world of the school of good and evil. Agatha, however, does not want to lose her and let her go, so she is pulled into this world with her. Agatha ends up in the good school and Sophie in the evil school. The reasons are mystical and fateful. The friendship of both is put to the test and there are forces that manipulate them both without them knowing anything about it.\n\nAgatha and Sophie are the embodiment of beautiful emotions for me. This pulled me in so much that I was rooting for them until the end and even couldn't suppress a tear at the end. Friendship, trust, bonding and commitment to friendship are what it's really all about. The rest of the film is incidental.\n\nThe emotional depth of the story is further supported by the beautiful background music, which I really liked.\n\nAesthetically, I also find the film really successful and beautiful. The scenery is beautiful, I like the setting as well, and the costumes and sets are really great to look at.\n\nAll in all, the film was really worth it for me, and I really wouldn't have expected that after FlyingKerbecs' words.

Sophie dreams of being a princess like in the fairy tale stories she's obsessed with, and after learning of the School for Good and Evil which trains the heroes and villains of the various stories that inspire mankind Sophie wishes to be enrolled in the school. Sophie initially plans to leave Gavaldon due to tensions with her family but is confronted by Agatha who tries to convince her otherwise. The two are pulled into the forest by a specter and taken by a bird to the School for Good and Evil but Agatha is dropped on the \""good\"" side while Sophie is dropped on the \""evil\"" against her protests she's actually good. Agatha reluctantly goes under the tutilidge of the Good school's dean Professor Dovey (Kerry Washington) while Sophie likewise is taught by Lady Lesso (Charlize Theron). Both Agatha and Sophie ask the School Master (Laurence Fishburne) to correct the mistake, but he says it's out of his power and only \""true love's kiss\"" is powerful enough to change anything. Meanwhile, Agatha sees the spectre of the supposedly long dead brother of the School Master, Rafal (Kit Young), who has insidious plans involving Sophie. As Sophie and Agatha work their way through the school, divisions form between them with their mutual affections over Tedros (Jamie Flatters) the son of King Arthur.\n\nThe School for Good and Evil is an adaptation of the 2013 fairytale fantasy novel of the same name by author Soman Chainani which became the first in a series of the same name which at the time of this writing now consists of six books forming two trilogies (The School Years and Camelot Years). Plans for a film adaptation of the books began in 2011 a full two years before the first book saw publication but it wasn't until publication of the first book that Joe Roth of Roth Films acquired the film rights with the intention of making the film a tentpole YA fantasy franchise as Roth had experienced success with Snow White and the Huntsman, Oz the Great and Powerful, and especially Maleficent and Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland all falling under that same extravagant family orientated fantasy fare that was quite popular in the early 2010s. The film languished in development hell despite Universal Pictures winning an auction for the rights with a seven-figure deal, with the box office underperformance of The Huntsman: Winter's War and Alice Through the Looking Glass also not helping the film's prospects. Eventually the rights landed at Netflix with a new creative team with the streamer interested in investing in new YA IPs to compete against the legacy brands of Wizarding World and Hunger Games. Comedy director Paul Feig was initially hesitant as he had no experience directing big budget fantasy films (Ghostbusters 2016 notwithstanding) but changed his mind after reading the script. Now after a 10+ year journey to watchable product, was it worth the wait? The movie does have the feel of something that should've come out about 10 years ago, but I will say that Paul Feig and David Magee do have fun with the formula.\n\nThe School for Good and Evil's biggest battle in terms of winning its audience will undeniably be in the sense of \""deja view\"" as The School for Good and Evil does feel like a remix of various movies you've seen from blockbusters past, down to films like the two Maleficent and Alice films released by Disney that share producer Joe Roth of this film. There's also the more obvious comparison to be made with the Wizarding World/Harry Potter franchise with the setting of a magical school/academy. With that said that doesn't make the film bad, just familiar and the movie does at least seem aware of this aspect so it never takes itself overly seriously and allows for some decent humor in its approach to this well worn material. Much like other modern fantasy films based around fairy tale themes and iconography, The School for Good and Evil is very much a deconstruction of those themes and filters them through the lens of our times by making the story about polarization and \""othering\"" and while that is a well-worn approach, I felt they did enough to make it engaging that I was never bored or thinking the film should \""move on\"".\n\nIn terms of the acting, I think the actors do a good job of making the material engaging. Sofia Wylie does quite well in the role of Agatha and she does a good job of endearing us to her as a protagonist especially with her more reserved and down to earth personality contrasted against the extravagance of the Good School which leads to some humorous moments with her annoyance at various facets of the Good School's culture. Sophia Anne Caruso does okay in the role of Sophie but I think there's something about the way this character is written that doesn't make it feel quite as natural a fit as with Sofia and Agatha so I always felt Sophie's characterization was a little \""off\"" in some way, I'm not quite sure how it could've been improved and given the nature of the character it's a challenging role to write and especially act but I don't think it quite sticks the landing in terms of performance. The movie also boasts a solid supporting cast with Laurence Fishburne, Michelle Yeoh, Kerry Washington, and Charlize Theron making up the various staff of the Schools and they're very entertaining in their performances. Kerry Washington in particular has a lot of fun playing a kind of tightly wound Fairy Godmother archetype and while Charlize Theron does recycle a little of her performance as Queen Ravenna from Snow White and the Huntsman, she's still very entertaining playing a character who loves evil and her scenes with Washington show some great comic friction. I also rather enjoyed Earl Cave's performance as Hort, the son of Captain Hook, and his performance and energy reminded me of the late great Rik Mayall. On a visual level the film looks very beautifully and handsomely produced with Academy Award nominated production designer of Gravity and Captain Marvel Andy Nicholson producing some beautifully decorated sets that are lovingly crafted. While the movie uses a ton of CGI as per the standard of this genre, Feig opted to use as much make-up and animatronics as possible so the movie manages to sidestep the \""rubbery\"" sheen look of some of these films fall into. I particularly liked the design of the wolf/human guards who supposedly were (in part anyway) animatronic.\n\nThe School for Good and Evil falls in line with similar YA fantasy fare, but it's well made and doesn't play itself too seriously and has fun with its world and performances. It's pretty obvious that Netflix wants this to be a franchise (down to an ending stinger) and given the series of books and production commitment it probably will be. I can't speak to its faithfulness to the source material as I've not read the books, but if you have a soft spot for things like The 10th Kingdom or the Maleficent movies you'll probably enjoy this."", ""Upvotes"": ""72"", ""Downvotes"": ""37"", ""Reviewer"": ""IonicBreezeMachine""}, {""Title"": ""Loved it"", ""Rating"": ""10"", ""Review Content"": ""Literally stayed up until 4am to finish this after work.\n\nThis is a similar way of going about this true love fairytale stuff like Frozen did, adorable and warm but not at all in a feminism in your face kinda way.\n\nLoved every minute of it and had so much fun watching.\n\nThe visuals are gorgeous, the twists and turns are exciting it never gets boring and you keep finding yourself rooting for a different character ever 15 minutes, because everyone one of them has something to like about in my opinion.\n\nIf you want to have a good time and get in the October mood, go watch this immediately!!\n\nOne more thing: Sofia Wylie... she is a rising star!!

The self-awareness is fun, the self-deprecation works, the Cage/Pascal chemistry is endearing, and the ending is heartfelt. However, the plot is lacking. Massive Talent admits that talky comedy and shoehorned action are lowbrow, yet plays into those tropes. The climax especially devolves into forgettable modern formulas. Therefore, Massive Talent combines wit with mediocrity, making it a mixed bag.\n\nMeanwhile, Massive Talent's technicals are minor. There's fitting music, believable production, and blending sound transitions. The editing is noticeable because it serves punchlines and maintains a tight runtime. However, the cinematography isn't proactive, the effects are sparse (besides a young Nick alter ego), and the direction is basic. The tone takes itself just seriously enough, but the presentation of this material is bland.

Damn you Nick Cage!\n\n... I wonder what movie of his I'll watch next.\""\n\nI've been a fan of his for so long. I think he's very talented and has a certain crazy appeal that you don't see from other actors. And I keep watching most of his movies even as they plummet in quality and rarely make it to cinemas. He still makes them entertaining, even if they are awful. This is a huge contrast to other former A-list actors who have gone down the same path but with unwatchable movies. Like fellow Face/Off star John Travolta or Bruce Willis (we will miss you!).\n\nSo when they decide to make a movie that's essentially all about Nick Cage, of course I'm 100% in. And I have to say, this is his best movie in years. It's levels above the quality of his recent direct-to-video movies and is definitely cinema-worthy.\n\nI laughed a lot. A couple parts had me crying from laughter. And when I wasn't laughing I was generally amused. It felt so refreshing to laugh with his movie rather than at it. And with the lack of comedy movies lately, this came at a perfect time.\n\nOther than the comedy, this is a mostly well-made movie with a story and characters that kept me invested. I love the meta aspect. Nick Cage's performance in this role is perfect. It has a good supporting cast with the standout being Pedro Pascal. He's so likeable and has great chemistry with Nick Cage. Their relationship drives the movie. Pedro Pascal is a star.\n\nI had a great time with this movie.

It's ... grotesque.\""\n\nThe unbelievable part of The Unbelievable Weight of Immense Talent is that it's all true (in a figurative way). Nicolas Cage can play himself, Nick Cage, because the many films he's been in, some worthwhile (Moonstruck, Raising Arizona, Face/Off) and some terrible (take your pick), have prepared him for a true meta experience, like John Malkovich in Being John Malkovich or the cast playing themselves in Robert Altman's The Player.\n\nOf course, it's hilarious because Cage is usually a witty version of himself and making fun of himself anyway (except when he wins the Oscar for Leaving Las Vegas). With the help of director Tom Gormican and writer Kevin Etten, Unbearable is a metanarrative of Nick as a burgeoning hero for his daughter, Addy (Lily Sheen), and a buddy for a drug kingpin, Avi (Pedro Pascal), with whom he writes a joke thriller, which Unbearable turns out to be.\n\nPascal's performance as a thorough Cage fan and possible drug lord emphasizes the often-close emotional bond between fans, star, and film. There is little difference between us and Avi in our love for the actor and his roles.\n\nThroughout this comedy, the art of filmmaking turns out to take center screen as the principals dog out a workable script that they really are starring in here, more or less because the fusion of art and life is blurred. The varied facets of filmmaking and the actor's relationship with his audience are never far from the surface. Nor is it stagnant because each Cage film is a mirror for Hollywood's immediate needs and its actor's. In Unbearable Nick's striving for the \""part of a lifetime,\"" never far from a cliché.\n\nFor Nicolas Cage, such is his life, and the film makes fun of his accepting roles solely for getting cash to pay his bills, and maybe, just maybe, for the joy of acting, for which he's indicted when he loses the people closest to him because of his obsession for acting.\n\nAs Cage plays himself, he stumbles on the right script to reconcile him with his family and win the admiration of his audience. He's never far from his Oscar in Leaving Las Vegas or a \""should-have-been-nominated\"" in Pig.

The former Oscar winner seemed to be back on top, making the National Treasure movies and seemingly on his way to movie star status. And then all of the drama. Money was tight, he had terrible spending habits and had to keep the bread baking. Questionable choices on top of questionable choices. The only thing that seemed to be consistent was every few films, we get a pretty good performance. And then the revolution on social media of commenting on terrible films and appreciating there awfulness became a trend, and people started noticing that even Cage's \""bad\"" films exuded a certain energy. People rightfully gave him credit for giving it his all even for the straight to video fare he did because he had a couple weeks off between other projects. The summation of this bizarre trajectory comes to a peak in this role.\n\nNeedless to say, this was the role Cage was meant to play...that being himself. It's always brilliant to see just how far someone will take their art and even lampoon themselves in the process. In the past, we saw Jean-Claude Van Damme do it with JCVD, which caused a bit of an eruption because it was a film about him, but the film was openly mocking him. If not for the heartfelt scene where Van Damme laid everything out and gave insight into his motivations, we understand just how difficult such self reflection can be. Michael Keaton also did this in Birdman, taking a swipe at his most famous character in an attempt to rid himself of his past and take on a new persona for his future. It worked, for he is back in big productions again and even won an Oscar. With Nicolas Cage, what is the commentary going to be?\n\nFor a Nicolas Cage super fan like me, this movie was a joy to watch. They whipped out some deep references in this film, and Cage seemed to take joy in lampooning his own performances. I forgot how much Cage goes \""full Cage\"" in Guarding Tess, which is a helpful reminder that he was pretty much the guy that was in offbeat comedies for the longest time. And of course, Cage's inability to handle accents is lampooned hilariously, especially when the characters openly love Captain Corelli's Mandolin, an absolute train wreck of bad accents and over the top mannerisms.\n\nWhat I especially love is how well Pedro Pascal and Cage interact with each other. You can tell they enjoyed the experience and had a boatload of fun with the material. Also, the bizarre interactions that Cage has with himself (you heard that correctly) are amazing.\n\nMany will say his was a just an ego trip for Cage, but when you see his recent body of work you get the feeling that was the intent. The man loves to perform, regardless of the project. As long as he gets some top billing and as long as people keep watching, why wouldn't he get a little big headed? Cage has definitely walked a strange route and seems fully committed to that journey, and as long as he has the chance to keep making unique projects and bring his \""nouveau shamanic\"" acting method to the forefront, I will continue to enjoy many of the strange outings he participates in."", ""Upvotes"": ""191"", ""Downvotes"": ""20"", ""Reviewer"": ""Agent10""}, {""Title"": ""Whether or not you are a Cage fan, you are in for a treat."", ""Rating"": ""10"", ""Review Content"": ""First of all, it is great to see Nick Cage working with such actors like Pedro Pascal who can not only keep up with Cage's screen presence but also enhance it.

There's also a powerfully melodramatic tone to this film that I'm frankly just a bit unsure of.\n\nI also think there are extremely bad reasons to criticize the film, and these reasons are starting to emerge as the consensus among critics in the mainstream media.

The storyline follows an African kingdom with a new(er) king in 1823 who posses the only female army in Africa. The leader of the female Army has a past that haunts her but the respect of her king, enough to be on his council. She strongly urges him to avoid the slave trade and find alternative methods of riches. Meanwhile, those who do believe strongly in the slave trade look to march on the kingdom and bring them down.

The writing is remarkable, thorough and very impressive. The character's inner demons are well portrayed as is their struggle to overcome them. The acting is out of this world across the board. You feel for every character; and if anything happens to anyone, you feel personally hurt. The villains were also excellent as is the outcome of each of them.

Yet even through the beautifully-filmed and well-choreographed battle scenes, moments of love triumph and make this film worth watching.\n\nSet in the 19th century in the West African kingdom of Dahomey, The Woman King follows the all-female group of warriors, the Agojie, and their general, Nanisca (Viola Davis) as they fight, not just against the rival Oyo and Mahi tribes, but foreigners who wish to destroy their way of life and take their people. Along the way, Nanisca must grapple with her past... and Nawi (Thuso Mbedo), a young girl among the ranks of the Agojie who turns out to shape Nanisca's future.\n\nDirector Gina Prince-Bythewood outdoes herself. Beyond being a film that does its bit to rectify historical exclusion of African narratives in Hollywood, The Woman King is a superb crowd-pleaser, with familiar thematic beats of moralism, love, and community and a fresh-enough take on the \""historical war film.\"" The sets transport viewers to pre-colonial Benin, and the cinematography, especially the use of light (inside the palace barracks) and color (the earthy tones of Dahomey's villages), further enhances the viewing experience. The background score by Lebo M. And Terence Blanchard draws on traditional West African music. It's simply goosebump-inducing to watch the Agojie charge into battle accompanied by soulful singing and the djembe and marimba. Good Lord - can Viola Davis do no wrong? The highly-proclaimed actress is perfect for the role of the ruthless, defensive, protective leader; the emotional depth Davis taps into is frankly impressive. She hits all the notes - trauma survivor, bereaved mother, sister in arms - impeccably. Davis' character's more conservative, regimented, typically \""top brass\"" attributes are beautifully offset by Thuso Mbedo's portrayal of Nawi, the newest recruit who seems to challenge every rule so carefully enforced by Nanisca (and isn't afraid to confront Nanisca as an \""arrogant old woman\""). Nawi and Nanisca's relationship flowers in a way that will make viewers say \""aww\"" and though the two tussle every so frequently, the duo becomes the most lovable part of the film - a tough contest. A close second favorite is Izogie (Lashana Lynch), a more experienced member of the Agojie, who is equal parts hilarious, profound, and sweet. My favorite line of Izogie's is essentially, \""We all have a lot to cry about; it is better to laugh.\""\n\nThe Woman King promotes liberty, staying true to yourself, standing up for what is right, keeping your head held high (but your arrogance in check), obeying authority while also making wise decisions for yourself, and protecting those you love. Nanisca fights against King Ghezo's (John Boyega) vision to sell their prisoners of war to the Europeans for guns and other \""valuable\"" goods, acting as a strong voice against racism and the commodification of humans.\n\nI give The Woman King 5 stars out of 5 and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults.

Spectacular. Breath-taking. Endearing. Empowering. Inspiring. Purposeful.

It's a slow, methodical build-up to an incredible story of strength, endurance, love, and loyalty. There's an excellent story to be told here, and there's no reason it should be rushed to tell it.\n\nEvery time I saw the trailer for this film I thought two things. First, I'm fired up to see it.

(I'll get to this later.)\n\nUnfortunately, aside from the committed performances from most of the cast (especially Viola Davis), this is also one of the clunkiest narratives I've seen put to screen in some time.\n\nThe romantic subplot is rushed and entirely without substance or feeling. The central young woman Nawi supposedly has a traumatic past that we are barely told about, and she has no character growth at all. She wants to be a soldier, so she does. She's arrogant and disobedient at the beginning of the film and continues to be like this to the end.\n\nDavis's character Nanisca has an arc-at least on paper. She is emotionally closed off due to trauma and then decides not to be. But this change happens within two minutes of screen time and occurs off screen. It's kind of hilarious how unearned it is.\n\nThe story has no actual fleshed-out antagonist. There are a couple of villainous persons but their goals are vague at best and cartoonish at worst.\n\nAll this could occasionally fall to the wayside if the action sequences were good. But this film has some of the worst action I've seen put to film this year.\n\nNearly all of the fight scenes are exceptionally clumsy in how they're shot and edited. Far more often than not, the shots consist of our heroes swinging at someone off screen or so visibly for away from them that it's obvious to anyone with functioning depth perception that no actual strike took place.\n\nEqually as often is the occasional shot in which the enemy soldiers literally-and hilariously-just patiently stand there waiting for the good gals to come take them down.\n\nOkay, now for the elephant in the theater: the insulting historical \""basis\"" for the film.\n\nFor a movie that wants to bemoan the evils of colonialism, the filmmakers really are colonializing the culture of nineteenth century west Africa.\n\nHow? By paving over the Dahomey's centuries-old historical acts of human sacrifice and voluntary brutal enslavement of both their own and foreign people. The writers slap their 21st century feminism on top of a historically brutal culture and call it a day.\n\nIn reality, the Dahomey would have scoffed at the idea of ending the slave trade, as they only stopped trading slaves in the mid-19th century because the British forced them to stop. But this film depicts most of them as freedom-fighting abolishionists and acts as though the slave trade didn't exist until Europeans invented it. This is nonsense.\n\nImagine if there were a film made today about the American civil war in which the confederates were portrayed as freedom-fighting abolishionists who had slavery forced upon them by the north.\n\nThis would be rightly condemned, so why aren't people enraged at the convenient erasure of uncomfortable history that is propagated by this film?\n\nIt's a largely incompetent piece of filmmaking, and it's an insulting, culturally offensive piece of writing.\n\nIt's shameful."", ""Upvotes"": ""900"", ""Downvotes"": ""169"", ""Reviewer"": ""benjaminskylerhill""}, {""Title"": ""The King of Better Balance, Only Limited by Time"", ""Rating"": ""9"", ""Review Content"": ""LIKES:\n\nThe Plot: A plot like this has the potential to be too extreme or get lost in one factor that everything else tumbles. Thankfully, The Woman King has succeeded on many fronts with a successful presentation. While nothing revolutionary that we haven't seen before, this film really takes a tired story and sharpens it into a spear of many elements that pulled me into the mix. The battle for slavery in the colony days holds many horrors and the movie really shows how one can make a film about fighting the horrors without going Disney on it. Amidst the overall plot are various subplots that focus on the kingdom aspect, which though not fully fleshed out like Game of Thrones, again holds great management with the time they have, establishing a good pace. It forges a community quite well, and that is the central pillar for this film to work with.\n\nThe Character Focus/Utilization: Much of the story's strength comes from the fantastic character focus of the story, and utilizing many people in the right amounts. True, Viola Davis is a main character, but the writers and director managed to extend the stories to other warriors that help give you more characters to attach too. Outside the woman warrior components, other factions hold their own merit, such as the King himself by Boyega, the evil ruler of the opposing empire, and even the love interest that forms later on in the movie. While not the most balanced, it again, keeps the components very well involved and helps spice up the tale we've heard so much.\n\nThe Cultural Aspect: Taking those characters and throwing them into a cultural tale was a brilliant choice for me. The Woman King will give you plenty of tribal activities to study and adore, finding themselves potentially captivated by the community's use of song, dance, chanting, and other rituals. Some might be hard, boring, or boastful, I'll admit that when they get a little long, but overall, very impressed with the cultural integration piece to establish the setting.\n\nThe Music: Another immersive element, this movie's film score holds two primary styles that might help get you into the setting they designed. No surprise, there is a lot of what sounds like African Tribal music to the works, the drums, shakers, and a few horns helping to give you that stereotypical sound the Lion King made famous for many of us. It works very well in the cultural settings and sometimes extends to other moments that describe the pain well. My favorite was the orchestral work, and there are moments where the theater's system amplify that sound to a very, very, high degree to sell that epic moment. Great use of music.\n\nThe Acting: No surprise, the movie has done very well to make the characters come to life in ways I had hoped they would. Not quite in your face feminist and tough, as many things choose to do, this tribe kicks major butt in the female led cast. Lynch is probably one of my favorite characters in this story, her balance is nice to see, and she shows so much in her ability to extend across emotional spectra to make a very realistic character. Young actress Mbedu crushed her role as well, getting a lot more spotlight than I had anticipated, but for the most part gets her acting down pat, including hysterical cries. I quite enjoyed her determination, but again the fact that she was not perfect was an incredible display of direction and restraint to again make fun characters. Of course, Davis is the star of the show and no surprise, she crushes it again. In what might be my favorite role of hers, at least in a while, Davis unleashes the tough woman attitude she wields so well, but then manages to pull some it back and open up her vulnerability. As the movie goes on, she may not cover quite as many levels of emotion her compatriots do, but somehow takes her angle and makes it work so well given the position of her character. Needless to say, but I will anyway, the chemistry is top notch and that's the successful part of all this ordeal is how well they work together.\n\nThe Costumes/Make Up: We aren't turning the women into orcs, elves, or donkeys, but they are transforming them into the tribal warriors of a kingdom. This film's use of costume and makeup is subtle, looking like something from a play, but again works so well in what it accomplishes. I loved the warrior looks, I loved the settlers rugged clothes showing struggle, but entitlement, and I loved the makeup evolution deepening on the scene as it brought those cultural moments to life for me.\n\nThe Setting: Small shot at this, but wow were the shots beautiful of the coast and plateaus of the kingdom. I'm not sure about all the set pieces and CGI work given the blend to this film, but the cinematography at moments is breath taking to see the world to such a degree as what they got.\n\nThe Action: By far my favorite part of the movie, the action of this film proves for the most part that we still have directors who understand dances of death. The Woman King has at least four action scenes I would call worth it, with a few micro moments to fill in the gap. In these moments, you get different feels for the moment, and the variety works very well to give these moments more of a reason than what many actors do. And in almost all the fights, the choreography is insanely good, with acting, moves, and stunt work blending together to really give the warrior's edge. I loved so much about this movie's battling, especially the epic fight about 75% of the way through the movie and feel that the bar is raised again for action choreography to follow.\n\nDISLIKES:\n\nA Little Scattered: The movie's plot is not perfect though, and like so many films requires more time to really capitalize on all the stories they tried to tell. The Woman King jumps around a bit at times, with several transitions diluted, or limited to these quick asides that in the grand scheme of things did very little to elevate the story. Not being mean, but so many stories does often lead to incomplete usage and there were potential stories that needed more fluff.\n\nJohn Boyega's Accent: It's a bit cheesy, it's a bit forced, but that doesn't mean I hate it. Boyega does his best with the accent given, and it's not as cheesy as some might have you believe. However, there were better ways to take the character if I'm being honest.\n\nThe Villains Are A Bit Simplified/Extreme: What this means is that the Woman King's great character development arc did not extend to the antagonists of the film quite as well. Where Nanisca, Nawi, and Izogie hold so many layers to them, the other guys are just simply extreme bad guys that are lightning rods of hate to put your ire against. In addition the stereotypical moments really shine in these characters and I had liked more time to give them some depth given the power they held.\n\nSome Hard To Watch Moments: Pertinent to the story? Yes they are, but that does not make some of the moments easy to watch if you can't handle the unfortunate truth of those times. Sensitive fans need to prep themselves for some hard to watch moments that might make the bile in your gut rise. I won't say much, but you've been warned that some details might be hard to watch.\n\nThe Final Fight is Poetic, But Not As Climactic: After the amazing fights and usage of the story elements, the final fight was a little bit of a letdown for me if I'm being honest. Sure, there are great moves at times, and there is a bit of edge to the madness, including some awesome moments of justice. But that fight before it was a thousand times better and I had liked a little more f that same coordination to make it feel like the film had not been rushed. Again, it has its own element and feel, but that last fight with so many things happening could have used a touch more time and planning for me to really call it the fantastic end it deserved.\n\nThe VERDICT: The Woman King had a lot of potential to be another political movie, but what I got was a great balance of many things that just needed more time to be perfected. While female led, there are plenty of other characters with side stories that work together quite well. It's a movie that pulls culture, visuals, costumes, and acting together to really create the tribe you expect to see. And the pacing of the tale, especially the utilization of action, might be some of the best I've seen in a very, very, very, long time. Sure, handling so much resulted in some stories not having the same kick I wanted to see, and there are shortcuts taken to compact it to 120 minutes like it wanted to do. However, the movie really did make a great theater experience for me and is worth the trip if you've got the time.

Alas, you have been misled! But what else are Hollywood marketing departments for than to trick potential viewers. More of a talky drama and less of an action extravaganza, \""The Woman King\"" tells a revisionist, alternative history of the fierce Dahomey kingdom. I am no historian, so, when walking into this movie, I knew literally zero of whatever the true story may be; instead, I simply desired a film with an engaging plot, and well-shot action sequences. \""The Woman King\"" has none of those to offer.\n\nFor a film that advertises the brutality of its characters, \""The Woman King\"" is surprisingly bloodless. With action scenes filmed in the typical close-up shaky camera style, this movie, in terms of its action, offers up nothing that you haven't already seen before, and seen done better. During large-scale battles the camera shakes, as if the cameraman himself is having a seizure; the violence is censored and neutered, with a lot of the kills occurring offscreen - because a movie about slavery just has to be dumbed down to PG-13 to become family friendly! Film is a business, after all.\n\nLuckily, you will find some entertainment value - or at least I did - when viewing the culture of the Dahomey tribe. I can't speak to the historical accuracy of what the film portrayed, but I do enjoy movies that show in such detail the culture of people who lived long ago, so I certainly enjoyed the various traditions and rituals that were shown on screen. Alas, I do have a complaint when it comes to this, though: What I thought would be my favorite part of the film, the military training, almost seemed like an afterthought with it taking up only a small amount of screen time. What, then, did the film focus on? Mediocre melodrama.\n\nWith actresses that act so well you wonder if they were preordained for success in the film industry, \""The Woman King\"" boasts Viola Davis and Lashana Lynch, two women who consistently give powerhouse performances. And while their performances are well done in this movie, the problem lies in the fact that \""The Woman King\"" has a weak script. Instead of telling a straightforward story about fighting back against slavers, for some reason the movie decides to add plot threads (including an underwritten and unbelievable romance) that I, frankly, didn't care about. So while I enjoyed the acting, I couldn't help but feel taken out of and bored with the movie since the storylines never really grabbed me - a lot of it felt like it was taken out of a comic book or graphic novel, complete with a revenge subplot that was borderline unnecessary in a movie that was already about seeking revenge against those who have enslaved them.\n\nA crowd pleaser through and through, \""The Woman King\"" is receiving both critical and general audience acclaim; with an A+ rating on Cinemascore, I'm sure that most will walk into and enjoy it for the historical epic that it is. However, the bloated plot, weak script, and worst of all, the watered down, unfulfilling, and incomprehensible action kept me from fully finding entertainment value in this movie because, as I often say, when the action in your action movie sucks, your movie sucks.

I didn't know the actor had such charisma.\n\nGenerally, the acting is good, especially from the aforementioned actors.\n\nNigerian born actor Jimmy Odukoya is a great villain who wasn't given enough screentime.\n\nI believe the character would have been phenomenal if his backstory had been explored.\n\nThe cinematography is below par (I have seen Nollywood movies with better camera work) but perhaps the biggest letdown is the action.\n\nThe fight sequences came off as really disappointing as it was easy to see that it wasn't real combat despite the impressive choreography.\n\nThe romance was forced and written in such a way that at the end of it all, I asked myself why it was there in the first place.\n\nThe musical score is sublime and the songs and chants got my attention.\n\nAt the risk of being bashed, I will end my review by saying The Woman King is a good movie that should have and could have been far more."", ""Upvotes"": ""378"", ""Downvotes"": ""334"", ""Reviewer"": ""mightyyendys""}, {""Title"": ""The Woman Who Should Be King"", ""Rating"": ""10"", ""Review Content"": ""It's been a minute since my last trip to the movie theater, there just hasn't been anything that sparked my interest. A sentiment apparently not just my own. The manager at my theater of choice told me they've been opening late in the day since there hasn't been anything to draw folks in. I fully expected this to continue to be the case unit at least next month until I stumbled across an Instagram post by Viola Davis for The Woman King about a 19th century elite group of female African warriors. Real life Dora Milaje, not only starring but also produced by Davis and her husband? No doubt I HAD to see this film.\n\nThe short and sweet of it? The Woman King is an exceptional movie.\n\nPeriod.\n\nSuperb acting lead by the incomparable Viola Davis is just the start.\n\nRising star Thuso Mbedu, Sheila Atim, and Lashana Lynch match Davis' power, ferocity, humanity, and emotion creating the heart/soul/core of the film. Their chemistry and interaction are mesmerizing and the solid foundation that the film is built upon.\n\nDana Stevens and Maria Bello's script is rock solid and perfectly encapsulates all the strength, warmth, humor, pain, triumph, joy etc. That so many \""female\"" based stories tend to lack and services both the story and actors beautifully. The richness this script has is a true rarity.\n\nHaving Gina Prince-Bythewood (Love and Basketball and The Secret Lives of Bees) in the director's chair is an added bonus. The opening sequence had me glued to the screen and I couldn't look away the entire film. Fair warning, the action sequences are brutal and glorious, completely unwavering in their ferocity.\n\nThe cinematography, musical score, sets, and direction all on point. The layering elevates the entire viewing experience.\n\nThe Woman King is not just 2 hours 15 minutes of Viola Davis and company kicking ass (thought that wouldn't be a bad thing) it's a grown up, character driven triumph that transports viewers to pre-colonial Benin in a fresh take on historical war films. I can easily risk over hyping from my own enthusiasm, and risk underselling for fear of saying too much. So, I say, if you have the slightest interest in this one, just go. The Woman King needs to be seen/experienced on the big screen.

Here he brings to the big screen the novel of the same name by Emma Donoghue. I have not read that novel and hence cannot comment how closely (or not) the movie sticks to the original book. The movie is deliberately paced slowly, reflecting the times of Ireland in the 1860s. Initially it is difficult to understand what exactly is going on (how can the girl sruvive for months without eating?), but then as the movie plays out, we finally see the bigger picture: a morality play on religion with different perspectives from the girl's parents, the doctor, the parish priest, and of course the nurse. Florence Pugh delivers yet another commanding performance as the English nurese (on the heels of her captivating lead in \""Don't Worry Darling\"" a few months ago). The movie features an outstanding score by British composer Matthew Herbert. The photography, shot on location in Ireland, is equally top notch. Bottom line: this movie grabbed my attention from start to finish, and is one of those that seemingly comes out of nowhere in the best possible way.\n\n\""The Wonder\"" had a very brief and limited US theatrical run in early November, and started streaming on Netflix just last night.

I thought this would have been one of them but it isn't.

This would have been better as a horror with some scares and supernatural occurrences to make it more interesting.\n\nThe given plot is rather boring. There's no action or suspense and the movie drags on a bit.

That's just one of the weighty questions at the heart of this meditative historical drama, one that's also concerned with the interaction of science and faith, free will, when or if to stage an intervention with people bent on self-destructive paths, and the sometimes overwhelming power of guilt - both false guilt and that which has more reason.\n\nTo call it patient - despite its under 2-hour running time - is an understatement, but it's never dull thanks in large part to the haunting score and soundscape, and Florence Pugh's truly remarkable central performance (she seems to be packing a few of those into her still young career). A strange and potentially alienating device opens the film, drawing attention to its artificiality, but in doing so it highlights that question of observation changing the observed and encouraging us to do what we're told the characters are doing - believing their own stories as we experience them.\n\nThere's a thesis to be written here on the film's theological allusions, one I won't attempt to start here. But it has caused me to reflect on my own experience of over twenty years as an ordained Anglican (i.e. Episcopal) priest. I've seen many people do a wide variety of things in that time, things done in the name of their faith, for reasons of guilt or redemption, that are destructive to themselves or those around them. I've even, sadly, met and listened to people who have been forced to experience precisely the horrific thing, the hidden secret of the past on which the plot turns. If it seems too awful to be true, I can assure you it isn't - for all this film's deliberate artifice, it's a deeply truthful one.\n\nDealing with almost as many fundamental questions as you might care to bring to it, this is a weighty, serious, but still moving film that's carried by Pugh's brilliance and the production's patient tone.

A miracle indeed, or is there more to it?\n\nThe movie is incredibly well scripted and fleshed out. The way the topics are developed throughout the movie are very engaging and original.

Even the unlikely or hard to believe elements aren't that much of a nuissance because it makes for a good story. It is slow, which is one of the reasons I would consider it more arthouse instead of a movie for larger audiences. The slow pace emphasizes how agonizing and painful some of the themes and events are.\n\nThe only thing that rubbed me the wrong way is there are a few short parts where the fourth wall is broken. In my opinion, it did not have a clear function and only reduced my ability to really immerse myself.

I don't mind fourth wall breaks in general, but here, it just kept me questioning for the first hour what it's purpose was. All of this is set during a period of time in Ireland when the Great famine was a problem. There was no need for a narrator. It was not a comedy. It did not add to the understanding of the plot. Even after finishing the film, I don't understand nor agree with the odd choice.\n\nOther than that, the acting is very good, especially by the main character (Florence Pugh plays the nurse who's supposed to keep watch of the fasting girl).

It felt like my heart was racing a million miles a minute while I watched it.\n\nThirteen Lives takes us on the journey of twelve boys and their soccer coach getting stuck in the Tham Luang cave in northern Thailand. The boys wanted to visit the cave; however, little did they know that there was an approaching monsoon that would soon after flood the entire cave. People from all over the world were watching their rescue attempt with the many challenging obstacles they had to overcome. Will someone find them inside the cave? If they do, will the boys get out of the cave in time before they starve, or run out of oxygen?\n\nThe acting in this film is phenomenal. The portrayal of these young boys, their coach and their rescuers is so believable that you feel like you are there along with them. The cast includes Colin Farrell as John Volanthen, Viggo Mortensen as Richard Stanton, Joel Edgerton as Richard Harris and Tom Bateman as Chris Jewell. The production team, led by director Ron Howard also delivered. The way the film is made makes you feel like you're actually in the cave with the rescue workers. It took a lot of effort and coordination, which is very impressive. Over 5,000 people, including cave divers, doctors, rescuers, Navy SEALS, farmers and others contributed to helping the boys. They put their own lives at risk to help the boys and their coach, whom they didn't even know! Without those people playing a part in this rescue who knows if they would have saved them. My favorite part is when the farmers give up their crops so water can flood them and divert the water from going into the cave. It took a lot of heroism and sacrifice to lose their entire crop in order to give the boys a better chance of surviving.\n\nThe message of this film is that working together is essential. You should be aware that there is a lot of blood in some scenes and there is some bad language used a couple of times.\n\nI give Thirteen Lives 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults.

She lives a fairly isolated existence ... by choice ... valuing her independence over close relationships. While at a conference in Istanbul, she buys a glass bottle as a souvenir and when she accidentally opens it in her hotel room, djinn Idris Elba emerges. Naturally, he tells her she has three wishes, but as she's an expert on stories, she's wary since all the stories she knows about wishing are cautionary tales. Since he needs her to make wishes to be free, Elba tells her stories about his past to explain how he ended up in the bottle and to build trust.\n\nThe advertising for this film is deceptive. The trailer and this poster try to convince you that you're getting some kind of magical George Miller action extravaganza along the lines of Mad max meets \""Everything Everywhere All at Once\"". This is nothing like that film. It's a pretty stately paced film that mostly involves Swinton and Elba talking in a hotel room, with Elba's stories providing the magnificent visuals. But even these stories are pretty deliberately paced. It's a film about ideas, not action.\n\nI really liked the ideas. It's about the role of stories in life and also about love and companionship. It's also about the idea of wishing for things and what we ultimately have the right to demand from other people.

Now, that is not meant to dissuade you from watching or enjoying it. On the contrary. It is simply meant to temper your expectations.\n\nThere is certainly much beauty in many of this film's scenes; from curious beauty in the mundane, to fabulous beauty in the fantastical. (There is also a musical scene that will spirit you away to decadent places). Sadly however, for some unknown reason, this film chooses to stay more in the realm of the mundane than the wondrous. The wasted shame in this is almost palpable.\n\nThe film also feels somewhat choppy or disconnected at times. This is especially true quite early, when it begins to touch upon and wander into the mythical almost immediately, but with no real explanation as to why or how those particular scenes tie in with the rest of the film.\n\nLastly, and most grievously, while all the right words existed for this story to be told ... it seemed to lack a bit of passion or fervor from the storytellers.\n\nAll this is NOT to imply that Three Thousand Years of Longing is without its merits.\n\nFor one, Swinton and Elba together (although IMO neither delivering their best performances), is still a treat. They are beautiful separately, and together, they are art. Neither however, could elevate the tone of the film because, intentionally or not, the MAIN TONE of several parts of the film, is more cacophony than cadence.

It's visually magnificent, it has very good acting and it's basic idea is original and even poignant but. There are a few very big buts in stopping it from reaching the potential heights it should've reached.\n\nIt's getting lost in its own meandering tale, though we've all figured out the point it wanted to make long before it spells it out on the screen. It want's too much to demonstrate it's about storytelling so all the stories we see on screen are so heavily narrated that many of their charming characters end up as puppets with only glimpse of the character they should have, preventing us from really caring for them or in other words leaving us uninvolved with big chunks of the story. The combination of a long meandering plot line that keeps the audience uninvolved is an obstacle almost no movie can survive.\n\nIf I did enjoy it it's mainly because of the leading couple - Idris Elba and Tilda Swinton - no they're not giving a gut wrenching performance - they're simply very very professional keeping the convoluted plotline from losing us altogether anchoring the viewers to the story without turning it into a soap opera, and it could very easily turn into one so I'm definitely grateful for that professionalism.

Much of his film work has revolved around the Mad Max franchise, but he's done a variety of work such as Happy Feet and The Witches of Eastwick. It's an eclectic mix which has led to his most eclectic film yet, Three Thousand Years of Longing. Although it's not his best work, Three Thousand Years seems to be a deeply personal film.\n\nThere are many idiosyncratic choices throughout Three Thousand Years which mark it as a passion project; it wouldn't be surprising to learn that the film languished in development hell or lacked the proper budgeting for its globe trekking story. Whatever the case, the joy for the material is evident, alongside some extremely obtuse and unrelatable elements. It's a strange film full of strange choices, zippy enough to be enjoyed in the moment but too jumbled for satisfactory mental congealment after the fact.\n\nThe film follows Alithea, a narrative scholar who uncorks The Djinn, a mystical being who has been imprisoned multiple times over thousands of years. The Djinn recants his history to Alithea, detailing the many loves and tragedies he has catalyzed in three ancient societies. Alithea must choose her own three wishes to fulfill her soul's most inner desire and help free The Djinn for all time.\n\nThere's much to unpack and many varyingly effective elements, but Miller dooms himself from the start with an awkward and forced framing device. Although the bulk of the story is The Djinn's, the film forces Alithea's point of view early, kicking off with one of her scholarly lectures and mind-numbing narration. The perspective is ostensibly chosen to build her character, but it's so far removed from the meat of the film that the viewer is immediately jarred when the gears shift.\n\nThe crux of the Three Thousand Years takes place in flashback, until it shifts again from The Djinn's vantage to Alithea's contemporary life, which is just as unsatisfying as the opening act; firstly because The Djinn is a more interesting character in every regard, and secondly because there's no thematic or narrative foothold anchoring the audience. We're thrust in, taken out, and thrust in again without explanation or purpose. Additionally, I pray we're not slipping back into years just prior when nearly every film opened with narration. Narration can kick rocks.\n\nThree Thousand Years opens and closes wobbly, but the majority of the film works because the narrative is taken out of Alithea's hands and placed into The Djinn's. Idris Elba's Djinn is a sympathetic and vulnerable figure. He's a perfect physical choice for the role, strong enough to give off an aura of invincibility and inherent strength, but compassionate and fragile enough to create a sense of danger and powerlessness. His deep, silky voice is also perfect, because the film is essentially a spoken word album with accompanying visuals.\n\nAlthough narration should kick rocks, his perpetual monologue is necessary to keep Miller's intended pace, his dialogue isn't gratingly mystical or overwrought, and he tells his story in a controlled and relaxed manner. As far as narration goes, it's a reasonable middle ground.\n\nThere may be a cut of Three Thousand Years wherein the fat is eliminated, narration is removed, and we simply watch The Djinn's story unfold in a more natural and visual style...but there may also be a cut wherein the story is unchanged, the narration is removed, and the viewer never has a prayer of figuring out what the hell is going on. Again, this version is a reasonable middle ground.\n\nAmong the chief pleasures of Three Thousand Years' high points are the unpredictability of the tales and the ever-shifting dynamics of power through the ages. Period piece politics are always fun because viewers are treated to the many elaborate and savage methods ancient monarchs used to keep power before the iron rule of law. Watching the uncertainty, paranoia, betrayal, and succession of each era unfurl is a blast, and the vignettes possess a streamlined, concise quality which the film as a whole lacks. Throwing a Djinn into the cutthroat mix doesn't hurt the intrigue either.\n\nMiller's direction is also assured and dynamic. There are a host of camera movements, some subtle, some not, which keep the viewer engaged and alert. There are dozens of stylized scene and shot transitions which broaden the scope of the film and aid in its impressive continuity.\n\nFor all the magic, mischief, and mayhem of the tales, the affair could've become deliriously ungrounded or unconvincing, like recent MCU films, but Miller knows (perhaps better than anyone) how to establish and accentuate atmosphere among utter madness. Editor Margaret Sixel also deserves praise for allowing the film to breathe.\n\nThe atmosphere of the film is laudable, and the costume and set designs are creatively amusing, but there is a visual nag throughout. The CGI here is plentiful and terrible. It's used for cobwebs, bottles, battles, and feet, among other things, and it's distractingly amateur every time. All of Miller's practical effects bravado from Mad Max: Fury Road is totally, glaringly absent here. In a film impressively managing to keep its artifice at bay through convincing mise-en-scene, the computer effects frequently threaten to crash the illusion. Do we really need CGI cobwebs?\n\nThree Thousand Years is enjoyable in the theater, but its charm quickly dissipates after the projector flickers off. The story is glaringly disjointed on a micro and macro scale. Because the film never establishes a tone or context, the viewer is forced to create one, orienting themselves as the plot flies by - focus is nonexistent.\n\nMotivations are also extremely hazy; Alithea's perspective and inclinations turn on a dime, jolting the film into its third act without rhyme or reason. Even much of The Djinn's story is cobbled together and somewhat rushed. The audience is given a plethora of details, but the eye and mind aren't drawn to anything in particular. Characters are hastily introduced and abandoned within The Djinn's tales and subplots are meticulously constructed for meager payoffs.\n\nOverall, Three Thousand Years of Longing is a unique and simple idea stretched to and beyond its limitations. The film feels both overly developed and like a first draft, connecting several threads without creating intention or meaning. It's a bizarre, frustrating tradeoff. Miller's visual finesse is refreshing, and the relatively low stakes are a relief, but the story is monstrously cluttered.\n\nThe film is uncanny, even among Miller's uncanny filmography, and its strangeness may unfortunately turn off many in the general public. That's a shame, as this type of bold vision and passion for the craft should be celebrated and supported. If you have any interest in seeing something outside the box, give it a shot, because there's honestly no telling how you'll respond - a dwindling sentiment."", ""Upvotes"": ""132"", ""Downvotes"": ""60"", ""Reviewer"": ""mattstone137""}, {""Title"": ""A gorgeous and enchanting movie which could have had a better final act"", ""Rating"": ""7"", ""Review Content"": ""George Miller's latest historical fantasy Three Thousand Years of Longing is nothing short of a pleasant theatre going experience. From its visual language to its scope and narration, this movie is charming from the get go. Adapted from a collection of short stories titled \""The Djinn in the Nightingale's Eye\"", it tells the story of a narratologist scholar who accidentally frees a djinn that offers to grant three wishes of her heart's true desire. When the scholar initially refuses, being all too familiar with stories of wishes and how they all serve as none but cautionary tales, the djinn then narrates to her the story of his three thousand year long life and how his freedom now rests in the hands of this unwilling scholar.\n\nEach story is its own vignette and each story collectively contributes to the unfolding of history on screen in grand fashion. It's truly amazing and therapeutically charming to witness these stories play out; feeling for the players, understanding their predicaments and relating to their miseries... Three Thousand Years of Longing is in every way as enchanting as the stories it tells.

As far as djinn stories go it's not as original but the way it's told makes it feel like something new, sets it apart from Disney's Aladdin.\n\nIn the second half of the movie it moves away from the magical ambience and becomes a romance between the two protagonists that have only loneliness in common. Idris Elba and Tilda Swinton gave great performances; however as the whole premise of the movie is storytelling, it does lack depth and emotional pull which could've elevated it from just a good movie to a great one. Because for something that only wants to tell stories, it's a little disappointing that the visuals were the most captivating thing about it.

They are also two very suitable actors for romantic comedies, and if we accept the idea that good romantic comedies can be made with characters (and actors) in their 50s or even 60s, then casting them in the lead roles of a film of this kind may be a good idea. However, to make a quality romantic comedy something else is needed - a believable story that makes us resonate with the characters on the screen, possibly fall in love with them or suffer with them during the screening of the film. 'Ticket to Paradise' by director Ol Parker did not have the chance of such a scenario. By basing their film solely on the charm and magnetism of the two actors, the filmmakers have failed in their attempt to deliver quality entertainment. Clooney (at the peak of his charisma) and Roberts try their best, but it's not enough to save the film from the fate of a mediocre comedy.\n\nDavid (Clooney) and Georgia (Roberts) married 25 years ago and divorced 5 years later. Lily, their only daughter is finishing her law studies and a wonderful career awaits her starting in a prestigious law office. On the farewell college trip to Bali, the young woman meets a local seaweed farmer, falls in love with him, and decides to remain on the island paradise in the Indian Ocean. The two divorcees decide to join forces to convince their daughter to give up her marriage plans. The reasons are their own experience of a failed marriage but also the fear that the girl is destroying her life, at least according to Western or American patterns. The first 10-15 minutes offer the opportunity for funny exchanges of replicas, filmed with rhythm and using appropriately the technique of parallel frames. These are also the best comedic moments in the film, in my opinion. It is what follows that disappointed me.\n\n'Ticket to Paradise' reminded me of a tradition of American cinema in which the film fits very well. It's about dramas, sentimental comedies or musical films produced in the 30s whose stories took place in the world of the super-rich dressed in tuxedos, sumptuous dresses and fur coats. Spectators of those times, preoccupied with economic crises and - towards the end of the decade - with the danger of war, filled the theaters where charismatic heroes played by actors such as Clark Gable or James Stewart appeared on the big screens. With a few changes in scenery and dialogues, 'Ticket to Paradise' could have been made then. George Clooney is, by the way, the actor closest to the profile of the great American actors mentioned, and he is formidable in this film. But I think that his charm (and to a lesser extent that of Julia Roberts) are not enough to carry the whole movie. The relationship between the two is too predictable and the parallel love story between the two young people is completely missed. Kaitlyn Dever as the daughter is, I think, a terrible miscasting. At no point do we see her as an intelligent young woman making a sensible decision. The way in which the natural paradise of Bali is described is at the level of tourist clips commercials and the presentation of the local culture smella paternalistic Western folklorism. I understand that the intention of the filmmakers is here also an escapist cinema that disconnects its viewers from the problems of the day, but in the absence of authenticity and a somewhat believable story, the effect risks being missed. I'm afraid that only the joy of seeing George Clooney and Julia Roberts again and together is what will be left after watching this film."", ""Upvotes"": ""88"", ""Downvotes"": ""33"", ""Reviewer"": ""dromasca""}]"

No movie star seems to work harder or push himself further than Cruise these days. Ridiculously entertaining Top Gun: Maverick. Cruise was in his early 20s when he first played Pete \""Maverick\"" Mitchell, the cocky young Navy pilot with the aviator sunglasses, the Kawasaki motorcycle and the need for speed. In the sequel, he's as arrogant and insubordinate as ever: Now a Navy test pilot in his late 50s, Maverick still knows how to tick off his superiors, as we see in an exciting opening sequence where he pushes a new plane beyond its limits. Partly as punishment, he's ordered to return to TOPGUN, the elite pilot-training school, and train its best and brightest for an impossibly dangerous new mission. And so the three screenwriters of Top Gun: Maverick - including Cruise's regular Mission: Impossible writer-director, Christopher McQuarrie - have taken the threads of the original and spun them into an intergenerational male weepie, a dad movie of truly epic proportions. They're tapping into nostalgia for the original, while aiming for new levels of emotional grandeur. To that end, the soundtrack features a Lady Gaga song, \""Hold My Hand.\"" It's nowhere near as iconic a chart topper as the original movie's \""Take My Breath Away,\"" but tugs at your heartstrings nonetheless. The action sequences are much more thrilling and immersive than in the original. You feel like you're really in the cockpit with these pilots, and that's because you are: The actors underwent intense flight training and flew actual planes during shooting. In that respect, Top Gun: Maverick feels like a throwback to a lost era of practical moviemaking, before computer-generated visual effects took over Hollywood. You start to understand why Cruise, the creative force behind the movie, was so driven to make it: In telling a story where older and younger pilots butt heads, and state-of-the-art F-18s duke it out with rusty old F-14s, he's trying to show us that there's room for the old and the new to coexist.

She was just 32.",United Kingdom,English,7.3,(198K),"[{""Title"": ""Bloated, Pretentious and Shallow Drivel"", ""Rating"": ""2"", ""Review Content"": ""Triangle of Sadness has received much critical acclaim and comes around with a plot that sounds interesting on paper. The truth is however that this movie is vapid, pretentious and exhausting drivel that doesn't deserve the attention it's getting. Let me point out how I have come to this conclusion.\n\nFirst of all, the movie exaggeratedly tries to criticize contemporary society. The world of modeling is fake and superficial. Influencers are self-consumed and shallow. The rich and famous are greedy and soulless. The poor are jealous and vengeful. This movie brings up so many tired old stereotypes that it doesn't become a satire of contemporary society but rather a satire of its very own kind: pretentiously moralizing films attempting to please trendy prejudices.\n\nUp next, this film is unbearably long and clocks in at two and a half hours. We are witnessing models doing a casting for ten minutes. We are watching a toxic couple arguing over financial matters for twenty minutes. We are introduced to a whole range of characters on a yacht for forty-five minutes. Depth there is none. Development there is none. Entertainment there is none.\n\nThe characters are meant to be antipathic. However, they are never fleshed out and remain dreadfully shallow to a point that viewers will simply not care about their fates at all. Their actions, discussions and motivations keep repeating themselves endlessly. Few movies have ever had so many redundant dialogues as this one.\n\nThe acting performances also remain mostly shallow. A positive exception is Dolly de Leon who shines as manipulative antagonist in the last third of the movie but is nowhere to be seen before. Harris Dickinson disappoints as protagonist since he doesn't have any charisma whatsoever. His looks are boring, his facial expressions are repetitive and his delivery is redundant. That isn't anything new however since he already couldn't convince in previous features such as The King's Man and See How They Run. Lead actress Charlbi Dean tragically died much too young. If we strictly talk about her acting skills however, she also doesn't have the charisma to carry this movie. She often overacts in an artificial way which becomes nerve-firing through two and a half hours. She never becomes one with her role and instead establishes a distance to it that makes it obvious that she is acting. Talented actresses and actors on the other side are underused in this movie. Woody Harrelson is limited to the role of a drunk captain who keeps yelling nonsense through a closed cabin door time and again. Iris Berben is limited to repeating the same seven words over and over again since she is playing a character that suffered from a stroke and can't express herself very well. The casting choices for this movie have been absolutely dreadful in my opinion.\n\nAt the end of the day, I would highly recommend you to avoid watching Triangle of Sadness. This movie doesn't live up to its exaggeratedly positive reception. This film doesn't even know what it wants to be: adventure film, black comedy, survival drama, contemporary satire, you name it. Ultimately, this film is nothing but bloated, pretentious and shallow. Even its concept offers nothing new. You would be much better off reading Lord of the Flies or even Robinson Crusoe if you are interested in an analysis of society in a context of isolation. If you absolutely want to watch a contemporary movie with a similar concept, go for Chinese production The Island.

So many young people come to find that their parents, one and/or both depending on the time, become way too much to deal with, and that finding attraction in others is something immediate and pleasurable and also forms friendships (like 4-Town... ugh and they're 5 teens what gives). So many don't know what to do with their bodies as they sprout hair all over and hormones rage like a furnace. Is it possible to find your \""center\"" when you're 13?\n\nTurning Red is no different than, say, the 400 Blows in addressing how a young person finds themselves at a crossroads of life and choosing a way to go is a conundrum on top of a pain-pile some days, this despite/because of the joys that come with being young and (sometimes/discovering one likes to be) carefree and DGAF about stuff like school and routines and rituals. That these two films are from very different countries and times and protagonists isn't the point, rather that Domee Shii, like Truffaut or Greta Gerwig or Reiner/King with a Stand by Me or (insert other Coming of Age serio-comic saga), finds through her art some compelling ways to express how these changes are vast and cruel and bewildering.\n\nIn this case, Mei doesn't know what to quite do with her Panda-y self, or more significantly with what her mother wants her to do with it. It's a film ultimately about familial vs self expectations, and it's realized and executed with a heck of a lot of heart, wit, intense cuteness (that box of kittens made me laugh hard), and enough pathos to crash through a dozen concerts. I do have a few nitpicks on my first viewing, some maybe a little minor that I know come with suspending a bit of disbelief (there was never any time the parents thought to mention the whole Panda-transformation curse thing), and some maybe not as much (not to give too many spoilers away, but would 4-Town or their legions of fans react like *that* after what happens in the climax of the movie? I don't know if I fully buy it, even if it still makes for a heart-pulling finale). And on a more fundamental level, you can kind of see what's going to happen with the Mom pretty early on.\n\nBut these little points don't take away from this being another triumph for Pixar - I almost want to say yawn another but these things are so much harder to pull together and click all into place than most realize - and Shii fulfilling her promise after the dynamic High-Cute Big-Cry energy from Bao (which if you watch again, as I did, is thematically so similar to Red). I love the characters, the vision of Toronto, and so much to do with how we all as younger people struggled through the UGH and AAGH of so much, and it's a movie that manages to remind the adults how profound it can be to confront that and reflect on it all.

The two are seated on an auditorium's stage, the audience silent, Ms. Blanchette / Tar fiercely intense as the Philharmonic Conductor describes her craft. This goes on far longer than you expect. And, in my opinion, far longer than necessary.\n\nThe next segment is a lunch or dinner at which Ms. Tar and an associate (Who is he? I don't know. But I should.) discuss the politics and interpersonal relationships going on in Ms. Tar's Orchestra: The Berlin Philharmonic. The viewer is a fly on the wall to this gossip.

But exactly what it is she did - I mean exactly - remains somehow vague. We never doubt her weaknesses, but would probably benefit from some more detail. Such as, What was her relationship to the person who got Tar into trouble. Was the person a student? A member of the symphony?\n\n5. The scenes of Blanchette / Tar conducting the orchestra are fine.

The film's narrative cuts out key elements of scenes that other filmmakers would have highlighted.

The film purposefully *doesn't* show you the \""important\"" elements of scenes or relationships between characters. You have to figure that out yourself, just like putting together the puzzle of who Lydia Tár actually is. Here's a quick non-related example:\n\nBill stared at the smoke in the frying pan.\n\nBill rubbed his nose five times and took a call from Ernest while sipping coffee at Station 271.\n\nIf those two sentences above were in a book, it would be leaving out major plot points that other authors would have filled in.

The premise of the film sees a young man getting recruited to go on a hunt for a long lost treasure.\n\nMain Character Tom Holland plays Nathan Drake and I can't help myself he is really entertaining to watch and I think this is just because of Holland's natural charm and charisma manages to drag him through. But the issue is that he just isn't what I wanted from Nathan Drake as a character, he is nothing like his video game counterpart and that is a big shame. I was watching the film and all I saw was Peter Parker just without his Spider-Man costume. Hopefully, this is only because this film came out just after Spider-Man: No Way Home but I do worry that Holland might become typecast and a one trick pony.\n\nSupporting Characters Mark Wahlberg plays Sully and it is a similar story to our main character. He has plenty of natural charisma to him and his chemistry with Holland is really good and at least there is some sort of character development on show. But I felt like it was Mark Wahlberg walking around and the character of Sully from the video games and that was the issue for me, he is just the same as he is in every other film and this is a slight shame for me. Sophia Ali plays Chloe and I actually quite liked her, maybe because she was the one performer I didn't recognise made her feel like an actual character and somebody who was actually interesting to watch. The bad guys didn't work though, Antonio Banderas is here but he is just your generic villain and I don't know when but it seems like when a European bad guy is needed then he is the one cast and it just didn't work here. Tai Gabrielle is better as a villain but she isn't that great either but was at least a physical enemy to Drake.\n\nStory The story did a pretty good job of showing a young Nathan Drake starting his career and leading us on a fun adventure story across the globe that had shades of Indiana Jones to it. There is some sort of character development attempted and the actors seemed like they were having fun here. But there is a lack of depth and direction for the overall plot of the film. I think it could needed to pace itself a bit better and focus on the characters a bit more and give the villains way better motivations.\n\nScript The film actually has a surprising amount of humour to it and I was chuckling my way through most of the film, mixed with a bit of heart made this alright. But there isn't enough here, I didn't care about the characters enough and sometimes it felt like the film relied on its star power instead of actually crafting these better written heroes and villains.\n\nStyle The style has some really good action scenes, including the crazy cargo plane scene that was in all of the trailers. The film is quite relentless too, the adventure moves at a pretty break neck pace which is good but it also harms the characterisation and plot of the film. It was a fun action film without the depth needed to become a good film.\n\nOverall Overall, Uncharted is a pretty average adventure film.

Ben remembers hooking up with her a few times and finally agrees to come to her funeral since the family believes it was a close relationship.\n\nThe film follows his interaction with the family when he learns they all believe that Abilene's overdose death was not accidental. Ben stays with the family, feeling the family seeks a kind of vengeance by believing in a murder myth. We meet the Shaw family, which includes Ty's two remaining sisters, a younger brother, Mother Sharon (J. Smith-Cameron), and Granny (Louanne Stephens). Initially, he writes them off as rural rubes but comes to understand things are more complex than he first imagined. He also meets a music producer, Quinten Sellers (Ashton Kutcher), who spouts theories on life's meaning that intrigue Ben.\n\nBen interviews the drug dealer, the family suspects, and the four law enforcement agencies that had jurisdiction in where Abilene's body was found. A couple of abrupt plot twists at the movie's end influence the podcast, Ben's self-understanding, and shift the film's concept of vengeance.\n\nI was very taken by the film. The characters that initially seem one-dimensional become more complex as the story unfolds. I didn't see the ending coming. B. J. Novak was excellent as the smug Eastern snob who learns a lot about himself.

It's not so unfamiliar though, there hints and cues to help you imagine what life is like outside of those the niche story focuses on, there's so many little side plots that you wouldn't usually pay attention to.

Anup Bhandari spoils his own spine-chilling formula of RangiTaranga with its unknown spiritual prequel."", ""Rating"": ""4"", ""Review Content"": ""Vikram Rona (2022) : Movie Review -\n\nAnup Bhandari got Superstar Kichcha Sudeep on board for his ambitious visual saga, Vikrant Rona. The film was supposed to be a 3D spectacle and an action adventure drama, but turns out to be a similar horror-thriller like his own \""RangiTaranga.\"" RangiTaranga is a great terrifying thriller with typical minor faults that any Kannada film has, but there was no need to spoil the formula by using it again. Anup never spoke about VR being his version of the spiritual prequel of RangiTaranga. Nobody knows, and even I didn't know it until yesterday when he told me so. What Anup does is that he tries to fit RangiTaranga in a typical Kichcha Sudeep style mass entertainer. But we all know it's a misfit. A major section of Kannada audience has already seen RangiTaranga, so Vikrant Rona has got nothing for them. For others, it may work, but on a low level.\n\nThe film is set in a remote village in the middle of a tropical rainforest where people witness a series of unexplainable events which they attribute to the supernatural. The arrival of a new, dynamic, and strong officer, Vikrant Rona (Kichcha Sudeep), creates hope for them, and he starts finding answers in his own style. But there is a catch to it. He is also searching for some personal answers, actually more for himself than for the villagers. Several flashback scenes reveal many secrets in the second half of the narrative, where you start noticing RangiTaranga's flavour and tricks. But there is a different story here with different characters, and it has nothing to do with horrors, as the film tries to suggest from the beginning.\n\nVikrant Rona is brought down by its horrible screenwriting. In the first hour, you have no clue about the surroundings. You even try to find a specific genre of the film, like whether it is an action drama, adventure drama, horror drama, romantic drama or supernatural thriller. The mess continues till the intermission point, which suddenly puts life into the dead script. The second half has a better draft, though. At least it doesn't bore you to death like the first half of the film. There are many unnecessary scenes, cheap-humoured PJs, loud booze, useless songs, and good-for-nothing moments, which drag the film to its lower depths. You feel exhausted by the time you reach the end, and then there is a loud, noisy RangiTaranga trick to wake you up.\n\nKichcha Sudeep has carried a massy image for years, and he continued the same with Vikrant Rona. This film required something else, something more, maybe, at least from what we expected before, but again the same issue of surrendering to the basics of mass entertainment. Nonetheless, Sudeep entertains you with some fight sequences and heroic dialogues, and that's all about it. Nirup Bhandari debuted with a bang in the Kannada cinema with Anup's debut film, RangiTaranga, and it seems that Anup has used him according to the non-believing image amongst Kannada viewers. He does what he is asked for and has a few surprising moments too. Neetha Ashok, Ravishankar Gowda, Vasuki Vaibhav, Madhusudan Rao and Chitkala Biradar are decent in their roles. Jacqueline Fernandez has a big role of 1 minute (excluding Item Number), and she looks attractive in every single frame.\n\nThe technical aspects of the film have their own ups and downs. You enter the cinema hall to watch a 3D film, which hardly has any scope for 3D visuals. But yes, whenever 3D effects are applied, it makes sure that they do please you. However, you have to wait for them in the long 147-minute runtime. The dialogues are cheap on many occasions, the cinematography is good and the editing is confusing. The film could've been trimmed by 15 minutes, especially those boring, dragging songs. VR has many flaws that spoil the entire mood of watching a new kind of action adventure. For instance, Vikrant has one fight scene in the forest where he can see or sense what's coming from behind, even if it's a small spear while everything's dark out there. The same man can't do the same in the climax scene. WHY? What happens to the lady _____ Oops, sorry, no spoilers, right? Let's skip that part and that other part too. In short, let's skip the spoilers, i.e. Faults.\n\nAnup Bhandari's direction seems lost in the first half, but then he grabs some of its hold in the second half, where he plays his old good tricks. The problem is that Vikrant Rona is too late. Had he made the same film right after RangiTaranga, or before, then it would have worked at the top level. Kannada cinema has improved a lot in the last 7-8 years with films like \""Ulivadaru Kadanthe,\"" \""Lucia,\"" \""Godhi Banna Sadharana Mykattu,\"" \""RangiTaranga,\"" and the mass hysteria of \""KGF.\"" Vikrant Rona was supposed to take it a step higher, with advanced 3D visuals, but all it does is take you 10 years back to those old-school action masala flicks. As a whole, Vikrant Rona literally makes you cry with its outdated body while its soul keeps searching for a new modern body.\n\nRATING - 4/10*"", ""Upvotes"": ""20"", ""Downvotes"": ""30"", ""Reviewer"": ""SAMTHEBESTEST""}]"

He also cleverly avoids the trap of playing Santa too dark, for all his boozing and necessary killing he is still recognisably Father Christmas.

Highlights include a Home Alone inspired sequence (turns out the invaders in this film are a lot less durable than Harry and Marv) and a Mortal Kombat worthy finish to the final showdown.

While Francis is fluent in the language--his mother is Romanian--Julia is not, and struggles with the language barrier. Even worse, she also finds herself being watched by a man in the adjacent apartment building, and comes to believe that not only is he stalking her, but that he is a serial killer.\n\nIt goes without saying that \""Watcher\"" is playing with a familiar concept--this is a premise we have seen in a large number of films, most famously in Hitchcock's \""Rear Window,\"" but \""Watcher\"" also pays respects to Roman Polanski's \""apartment\"" films, most notably (and effectively) \""The Tenant\"" (the other two being \""Rosemary' Baby\"" and \""Repulsion\""). What makes it stand out, however, is that it is well-acted, visually elegant, and at times throttling in its suspense. There are a number of scenes in this film that (no pun intended) grab you by the throat.\n\n\""Watcher\"" is the breed of film that toes the line regarding whether or not the fears and paranoias of the protagonist are legitimate, or the product of something else, but director Chloe Okuno telegraphs it intelligently by positioning the audience in tandem with Julia--as we watch her sink into her isolation, we are isolated alongside her--and it is because of this that her fears play out as believable, despite her husband's skepticism. The writing here is both subtle and smart, and there are a few key moments that are as dislocating to the viewer as they are to the protagonist; the screenplay is multi-pronged in a way that makes the audience question not what they are seeing, but rather, what it is indicative of. Julia's disconnect from the language only helps to reinforce a sense of suffocation, and the gloomy, rain-soaked Art Deco architecture of the city only amplifies the sense of unease.\n\nOf course, none of this would work without a believable lead, and Maika Monroe plays this character very effectively. Burn Gorman is also extremely effective as the mysterious creep across the way. The film's finale, though tense, is still fairly downbeat (which is the status quo in this film), but it offers enough grand guignol to be memorable and shocking. In the end, while \""Watcher\"" is not necessarily revelatory, it is a well-crafted, nervy take on a well-worn concept.

Sophisticated writers don't make you aware of their writing, i.e. Character actions were motivated by the writer's need to create drama, which we need, but it has to come naturally, not forced through dumb decisions. For example, characters act against their own self-preservation and put themselves at risk when there was no need to. I didn't believe one thing she did.\n\nIf something consumes you, like the watcher you would be asking people around and sharing your story.

But the success of the film lies with the lead actor, Daisy Edgar-Jones (a very talented Brit, who earned respect for her talents in another best selling novel adaptation for television, NORMAL PEOPLE). There is a wide eyed innocence about Kya that she captures which, in turn, captivates the audience to invest in her story and her plight. (The only disconnect I had with her portrayal was not her fault but that of the production. For a swamp girl, living off the grid, her personal hygiene and wardrobe were spotless and fitted to perfection. A seemingly unlikely possibility considering her environment.)

The plot is all over the place, the dialogue very stylized, and the overall atmosphere is engaging but off-putting. It's the type of movie that is sure to cause a lot of division in audiences.\n\nAt its core, White Noise is about a college professor named Jack and his middle class family dealing with their fear of death, but what actually happens is quite complicated. So complicated, in fact, that it feels like three separate movies smashed together. To be fair, the novel is just as ungainly and incoherent, but at least you had the sense that you were the one with the problem. There was a mystique to DeLillo's writing that made it seem like there was a lot going on thematically with the strange choices. But in the movie? It just seems like bad, pretentious writing. I'm not even sure if Baumbach knew what DeLillo's aim was, or if he just guessed.\n\nOne symptom of this is that the unnatural dialogue stick out like a sore thumb: in a scene where Jack's wife, Babette, says how open she is with communicating her feelings, Driver says \""That is the point of Babette.\"" In another moment, Jack is shopping with his coworker when said coworker suddenly says that Jack's wife's \""hair looks important.\"" What is the point of lines like this? Because all it accomplishes is taking you out of the moment and reminding you that you're watching a movie with a script. Not to mention the multiple long, unintelligible \""philosophical\"" monologues that occasionally pop up. Is it an intentional commentary on the hollowness of academia? If so, then why are they presented so uncritically and played dead straight? It's just another disjointed element of the movie that seems unfinished.\n\nBut even if the script fails them, the cast and tech crew don't give up on trying. Driver and Gerwig give very different performances, the former acting almost like an intentional caricature of a sitcom dad, and the latter trying to be serious the whole time. And yet it's one of the few disparate combinations in the film that actually pays off: their acting is convincing as a real couple. Gerwig, in particular, brings emotion to scenes that were completely absent of it on the page. The production design and score are also on point, creating a distinct and interesting atmosphere that also furthers the film's supposed social commentary. But none of this is quite enough to save White Noise from itself and its shortcomings.\n\nThe best part of the film is far and away the end credits. I'm not saying that as some sort of flippant joke about the movie's quality, it's a genuinely incredible sequence. Somehow it captures the exact type of weirdness and existentialism and fun that's absent from the rest of the movie. It's so good that, in all honesty, you could probably skip the rest of the movie for it. White Noise is consistently watchable and unique, unlike anything else you'll see this year.

But so what? Does that ruin the possibility for entertainment? Not a bit. This is a film that delights in being muddled, fragmented, and many things at once.\n\nWhite Noise is fundamentally a strange and unfocused ramble of existentialist angst, full of surreal and absurdist humour with a little horror thrown into the mix from time to time. The plot is divided into very distinct chapters which constantly lurch through styles and levels of seriousness and silliness in a way that often reminded me of Netflix's miniseries Maniac, especially given the retro setting and the obsession with the medicalisation of personal problems, and the desperate hope that a little crackpot scientific advancement could save us all. The po-faced absurdity of the characters and situations is also reminiscent of Baumbach's earlier work with Wes Anderson (particularly The Life Aquatic, for which he wrote the screenplay).\n\nAdam Driver is at his most hilarious as the pompous academic, with Don Cheadle excellently serving as his tirelessly philosophising sidekick. In fact everyone is a delight to watch, even Greta Gerwig (how does she manage to be so watchable and yet so abysmally wooden at the same time?). The plot takes this hapless group into some wild and extreme places, and by about the 90-minute mark I was honestly having so much fun wondering where this trip would go next. Unfortunately, the film does sag in its final episode, as the plot becomes less imaginative and more familiar in subject matter.

Many people suddenly appearing are not getting introduced. Many times you wonder: \""Who is this new other person she's now talking to all of a sudden?\"" or \""What has happened causing this scene? Did I miss something?\""\n\nJust a few examples (nothing to spoil about):\n\n° Whitney signs her first contract. Cut. She listens to a number of tapes at her producers', selects one of the songs, convincingly claiming: \""I'll add a hook to it\"". Cut. (And that's all. We don't get to see how she actually does \""add a hook\"" to the song.) Next scene: We get to see a 1:1 copy of the music video.\n\nSo, we never see her working creatively in the studio. She never performs any musical effort in the movie.\n\n° Whitney's producer is showing her the Bodyguard script. Cut. She sits in a beedroom scene, getting her hair done, walks to the window and breaks down. Cut. She's lying in a hospital, crying. Her husband's telling her that they will be giving birth to another child. Cut.\n\nYou wonder: Huh?!? They actually had been expecting a child?

However, when the camera is so close to the singer's face, then - please - take better care of lip-syncing! - You should have done better! A cut takes usually 5 - 10 seconds. It shouldn't be too much of a demand to expect that Naomi Ackie practices the singing sequences again and again, until she fully got them. And only after that, they should have shot the scene again and again, until it fits! Plus, Naomi forgot to mimic Whitney's classic tongue vibrato. Naomi's tongue was stiff as a whale when we heard Whitney singing a vibrato.\n\nAnother thing:\n\nWhile we've been listening to Whitney's original voice recordings, the instruments have been re-recorded to be rather dull and in the background. So many times you can see musicians who are playing an instrument that's actually not to hear in the mix.\n\nSo, as I stated in the beginning of my review, this wasn't a well-done movie.

Here, everything was bland, there was nothing to make this stand out from the crowd.

Instead I just saw her trying to be the next Rami Malek and Austin Butler, and personally I don't think she is quite on that level yet as an actor.\n\nThe movie also felt very shallow, it never went deep into exploring Whitney's life, instead just went from scene to scene checking off the boxes of major events in Whitney's life, carefully following the template of the music biopic. The script really was not anything special, and honestly I found it didn't work as a narrative at all. There was no conflict, no tension, nothing to keep me invested as an audience member.

The movie portrayed John as an aggressive father who only cares about making and spending money off of her daughter. There's some truth to this.

The film is a chamber piece featuring only three actors in an isolated setting and feels like it harkens to other isolated chamber thrillers like Wait Until Dark or Dial M for Murder. While the movie featres some solid performances from its cast, it feels a little confused in its thematic elements.\n\nWhile like many home invasion thrillers of this ilk, the movie is a cat and mouse game involving the invader's objective for money or some other valuable McGuffin, the movie tries to add a thematic subtext of class disparity and economic abandonment. The characters remain nameless throughout the story and are solely defined by their importance in the plot as well as their socio economic statuses. It's hinted throughout that Jason Segel's character has been made \""redundant\"" thanks to an algorithm developed by Jesse Plemons CEO and the movie tries to tap into that working class frustration seen with paradigm shifts in our economy that have left many behind with absolutely no plan or consideration for where they go. Jesse Plemons as the CEO is really good acting as sort of an amalgam of several wealthy archetypes with a lot of grandstanding about being \""self-made\"" and derision about those on lower rungs as \""lazy whiners\"" who give up at the first obstacle and the movie tries to establish this situation as a microcosm of class tensions in a way similar to how Knives Out broached the subject of political tensions (albeit with dialed back humor and a way grimmer approach). Lily Collins plays the CEO's Wife, and her positioning in the film is strange. Collins character is established as having started out as an assistant saddled with student loan debt prior to marrying the CEO and now runs the charitable foundation of the CEO's company. She's also got a strained marriage with the CEO thanks to his infidelity and it's established pretty early on she harbors some resentment towards him.\n\nThe movie had me engrossed throughout thanks to the strength of its leads with Jason Segel playing against type in a more serious role as well as Jesse Plemons as an intriguing character who you're never quite certain of, and even Lily Collins despite playing a more nebulously defined character is still engaging in the role. But the movie stumbles in the third act. Per the standards of other Andrew Kevin Walker movies like Seven or 8MM, the movie tries to have a shocking twist which it is, but it's a twist that makes you think \""why exactly did that happen?\"" and it feels like it throws away much of the themes it was trying to discuss because it couldn't figure out how to tie them up and instead just goes for some brutal violence.\n\nWindfall is a solid enough chamber piece and a showcase for its three leads' talents, but on a story level it struggles to establish the themes it brings up and stumbles in the third act basically throwing away all the buildup for the sake of a shock that doesn't make sense on a character, storytelling, or thematic level."", ""Upvotes"": ""46"", ""Downvotes"": ""18"", ""Reviewer"": ""IonicBreezeMachine""}]"

This fact-based story about a group of women from a conservative religious colony who meet to discuss how to respond to a series of sexual assaults in their community unfolds in a circular, wooden, stagey fashion that plays more like a university discussion group than a work of dramatic cinema. The ideas raised in these dialogues - ranging from activism to passivity to intergender relations to forgiveness to faith and salvation - are certainly lofty topics for consideration and deliberation, especially in terms of how they might be addressed in the forging of a new and better world. But their handling here is so forced and inauthentic that the entire exercise lacks believability and does little to foster a sense of concerted viewer engagement. And, as the narrative drones on and on, it becomes tediously dull, with one of the characters herself astutely observing that \""This is very, very boring\"" (well said, if a bit ironic). What's more, a number of incidents and themes seemingly arise out of nowhere and aren't always fully resolved, making one wonder why they were included in the first place.

Eight women participate in most of the discussion. Two grandmother matriarchs are Agata (Judith Ivey) and Greta (Sheila McCarthy). The next generation includes Ona (Rooney Mara), an unmarried woman pregnant with a child resulting from rape. Mariche (Jessie Buckley) is married to a very abusive husband. Salome (Clare Foy) is Ona's younger married sister who is very angry over the abuse of her young daughter. Some girls from the next generation provide comments and some narration to the film. Scarface Janz (Frances McDormand), another matriarch, leaves the discussion early. Since the women are illiterate (only boys go to school), they ask the schoolteacher, August (Ben Whishaw), to record their discussion. August, who had left the colony with his mother, was university-educated but was allowed to return to teach school.\n\nThe film shows no sexual violence but does show some results of the violence. The only adult male face seen throughout is that of August. The women discuss three options: staying and forgiving the perpetrators, staying and fighting the perpetrators, or leaving with all the children under a certain age. They must make a quick decision because one of the men is returning from the city in the evening.

And a university-educated August would never be allowed back to teach in such a conservative colony.\n\nSarah Polley extracts the story from Mennonite specificity (the film never mentions the word and doesn't mention \""Mennonite\"" last names). Polley uses very subdued colors in the filming, reinforcing the conservative impression. Although the movie's setting still looks Mennonite, its greater abstraction allowed me to focus on the issues being discussed--rage, forced ignorance, the necessity of faith and how to reconcile this faith with what happened, how best to embody their pacifist ethic, etc. The discussion is wide-ranging and doesn't provide easy and ready solutions. Rooney Mara, Claire Foy, and Jessie Buckley are excellent as they express contrasting and shifting perspectives.\n\n\""Women Talking\"" probably needs to be seen multiple times to get all the layers.

Something like that.\n\nThe conversations are as follows: Let's stay and fight. No, if we stay, I'll be the murderer. Lets go. No, if we go, we are covard. Then god won't let us into heaven. Lets go. Let's stay. Let's fight. No, let's stay. Men can come too. Early children under the age of 12 will also come with us. No, they won't. No, they will come. What if there is a 13 year old ? Men over 13 are stupid and dangerous. No, men can come too. Let's stay, this is our home. Maybe we can forgive men. No, they are all bad. No, it's not all bad. No, let's go. Blah blah blah.\n\nConclusion ?\n\nNothing. Leaving ?\n\nIt's a boring movie of 1 hour and 44 minutes.\n\nI can say that the acting is very good and the cast is very good. The footage wasn't bad either. But in a movie that depends on dialogues and conversations, I would expect more intelligent dialogues. It's a pity. Everything depends on religion. It would have been better if they had studied, searched their religion, what they believed (or rather what they were persuaded to believe), had been educated and left the community. But, I don't know. The movie pissed me off. There are some good things in the movie. Except for the script. Also, this movie was nominated for two Oscars. One of them is in the best movie category.

The cinematography and camera angles are out of this world, as is the use of lighting, sounds and the soundtrack. The kill scenes, gore and blood splatter are on point.

It sets itself up as a smart take on the slasher films of the 70s and early 80s. As a bonus, the film within a film has the filmmakers making an 'elevated' porn flick (as a bonus, actor Owen Campbell who plays the \""Director\"" even looks a bit like Director Tobe Hooper).\n\nQuite consciously taking it's set up from Tobe Hooper's 1974 TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, X has a group of randy pornographers renting a farmhouse from an elderly couple in the middle of nowhere in Texas (actually New Zealand). Writer-Director West's main idea here is to set up a contrast between the XXX filmmakers and the bible thumping civilians of the area. It's not an uninteresting idea, which, of course, plays off the the puritanical cliche in the slasher films of yore where the most sexually active characters are the most likely to g et killed off. In addition to MASSACRE, West includes nods to FRIDAY THE 13TH, Hooper's EATEN ALIVE and a very specific one to HALLOWEEN. X is set about 5 years after MASSACRE so that it can include a brief exchange about how home video will change the porno industry (adult films were already available on VHS for about 3 years).\n\nThe movie is very well directed, with savvy use of cross-cutting between the porn film in the making and the terrors that await the group. Mia Goth (in a dual role; actually a triple if you stay after the credits) and Brittany Snow are the two pornstars to be and each dive in with relish. Kid Cudi is the cocky stud, while Martin Henderson is solid as the confidant Producer. Jenna Ortega is the \""crew\"" all by her lonesome (she manages to keep her clothes on - must have a better agent). Stephen Ure is the ornery old man who rents out his guest house.\n\nAs good as the filmmaking is, X ends up feeling too studied. The pacing is lugubrious even if it picks up towards the very end. Once the massacre begins (if not by power tools) it still ends up being fairly typical of the films it's commenting on, regardless of how well executed and 'elevated' it thinks it is. It's also too drawn out to satisfy some gore-hounds and once the blood starts flowing, probably too gross for the internet scribes dreaming of doing extended online essays dissecting it for it's elevated intellect. There are a couple of twists, but they aren't sufficient enough to compensate for the predictability.\n\nIn the end, it's not as clever as West thinks it is, and despite some good Directing chops and acting, it's simply too self-conscious to be much of a fun thrill ride."", ""Upvotes"": ""224"", ""Downvotes"": ""79"", ""Reviewer"": ""gortx""}, {""Title"": ""Perfect slow burn"", ""Rating"": ""9"", ""Review Content"": ""A very stylish rendition of original porn leading to some brilliant horror set in 1979 that is well written and fun to watch!

The gore is well done, the acting is very good I think, and the overall slasher aspect is reasonable, though it could have been a little more creative.\n\nSaying all of that none of it is what I'll remember this movie for.

He does this by primarily bringing attention to the sex parts of the genre and exploring what sex means. This is, after all, in part about a crew of people attempting to make a porno. But the sex angle goes beyond just cheap titillation. It is at the heart of the film, and West seems to be most interested in what the experience means, whether it's for love, a way to recapture youth, or getting the most out of life while one is still capable of experiencing the act.\n\nBeyond all this, though, is a fun, classically styled slasher that is equal parts titillation and slasher mayhem. Some may find the amount of nudity and sex, and heck the subject matter itself, distasteful, but for slasher fans, this will remind you of much of the early years of the genre. A lot has been made about how this is so heavily inspired by Texas Chainsaw Massacre and it's easy to see why. The majority of the film revolves around the singular location, an old farm seemingly in the middle of nowhere, Texas, ripe for plenty of slasher fun. Ti doesn't skimp on the red stuff either. While nothing gets too outlandishly creative, we do get some brutal kills with often gory results.\n\nIt helps that characters are written well and likable. Despite the sleazy material they're attempting to create, they don't feel shallow or sleazy themselves. They believe in their work and the reasons for making it. While it may have been nice to get a little more depth out of them, they clearly have history and there are things hinted at that never get much development, they're at least a decent crowd of folks who are fun to be around. As for the villains, they're not quite as out there or mysterious as the trailer would lead you to believe. In fact, they're pretty grounded, but never the less creepy and tension is maintained consistently once the violence starts.\n\nIf you know what the film's about, you have a pretty good idea of what to expect. It does take some unusual turns, but for me that only added to just how much the film stood on it's own. It certainly feels like a fresh entry into the slasher genre, something the genre needs. Ti West continues to make a name for himself as someone to watch out for. Have fun with this sexy, bloody good time."", ""Upvotes"": ""170"", ""Downvotes"": ""111"", ""Reviewer"": ""cadillac20""}]"
